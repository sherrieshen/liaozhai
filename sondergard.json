        "body": "The grandfather of my elder sister’s husband was named Song Tao, a scholarship student in his county. One day, while he was ill and lying in bed, an official leading a white-blazed horse brought him a formal document and told him, “You are requested to attend an examination.”\n\nSong replied, “The civil examiner hasn’t arrived yet, so why has an examination been set so hastily?” The officer didn’t answer him, but just urged him to go. Though weakened by his illness, Song rode out after him on his horse. The route was very unfamiliar.\n\nFinally they reached a city which looked like a king’s capital. After a while they entered a palatial building. Seated there were over ten officials, all unknown to him except for Guandi, patron god of war.\n\nUnderneath the eaves of the house, two tables had been set up with a seat at each, and a _xiucai_ had already been seated at the one on the right, so Song sat by him at the other. On each table was a pen and a writing tablet.\n\nSuddenly the topic, on a piece of paper, fluttered down from above. Upon looking at it, they found seven words: “One man, two men; intentionally or unintentionally.”\n\nWhen the two men finished their compositions they submitted them to the examiner. Song’s essay included the words, “He who does good deeds intentionally should not be rewarded for it; he who does evil, but without malicious intent, should not be punished.” The deities passed it around, and gasped with praise for it.\n\nThey called Song forward and told him, “Henan is in need of a Town God, and you would suit the position.”\n\nThe significance of this dawned just then on Song, and bowing his head, sobbing, he said, “It’s a great honor to me, so I shouldn’t have any excuses, should I? Yet my old mother is in her seventies and since there’s no one else to wait upon her, please let me stay with her until she finishes her natural span of years. Then I will obey your bidding.”\n\nOne of the deities, resembling an emperor, at once commanded that the mother’s longevity record be examined. An official with a long beard held a volume and leafed through it, then stated, “She has nine years of life left in the mortal world.”\n\nWhen all of the deities hesitated about what should be done, Guandi replied, “Why not just let scholar Zhang take the seal and hold the position for nine years—then, later on, Song can take his place once he’s ready.”\n\nGuandi told Song, “You ought to attend to your appointment at once; but for now, due to the benevolence and filial piety in your heart, we’ll grant you a leave of absence for nine years. When that period is through, we’ll summon you again.” He also gave some words of encouragement to Zhang.\n\nThe two scholars kowtowed and left together. _Xiucai_ Zhang took hold of Song’s hand, accompanied him to the outskirts of the city, and introduced himself as Zhang from Changshan. He offered a poem as a parting gift and though Song subsequently forgot most of the words, part of it went, “When there’s wine and flowers, Spring is always here; / Even without candle or lantern, the night itself is bright.” Song then rode away, leaving his fellow behind.\n\nWhen he returned to his own neighborhood it was as if he’d just awakened from a dream. In reality, he’d been dead for three days. His mother heard a groan from inside his coffin, helped him out, and after half a day had elapsed he was finally able to speak. He inquired about Changshan and found that there really was a Zhang there—who’d died the very day he had.\n\nAfter nine years, his mother did, indeed, die. Once her funeral service had been concluded, he washed himself, went into his room, and quietly died.\n\nThe family of his father-in-law, who lived in the city by the western gate, suddenly saw Song—among a multitude of carriages and horses with engraved belts and red trappings—enter their main hall, make an obeisance, and then leave. In their mutual surprise and bewilderment, they didn’t realize that he had become a god. They hurried to his neighborhood for news about him and discovered that he had died.\n\nSong had recorded a brief autobiography, but, regrettably, in the chaos that followed his death, it did not survive, and this is merely a summary of it.",

He was a practicing enthusiast of Daoist breathing exercises, ceasing neither in cold or heat, and carried on like this for several months as though sure he would gain some special advantage through it.\n\nOne day he was just meditating cross-legged when he heard a tiny voice like a fly’s, saying, “Okay, it can be revealed now.”\n\nAs soon as he opened his eyes, he could no longer hear anything; closing them and calming his breathing, again he could hear the voice as before. He figured that he had achieved this by focusing his vital energy and was secretly overjoyed. From then on, every time he sat in meditation he would listen for it. He figured he’d just wait until the voice came back again and spoke, then he could open his eyes and have a look at it.\n\nOne day, it started to talk again. So Tan said in a tiny voice, “Okay, it can be revealed now.”\n\nImmediately he felt something flying around in his ear, and then it seemed to come out.\n\nLooking sideways at him was a little man about three _cun_ long, with a fierce and terrifying appearance like that of a yaksha, whirling around and around on the ground.

The little man heard this, became alarmed, and circled the room like a mouse that’s gotten lost from its hole.\n\nTan felt himself lose consciousness, and when he came to, he had no idea where the little man had gone.

        "body": "An old man once resided in the village of Caidian, in Yangxin county. About five or six _li_ from the village, the man and his son established a roadside inn to lodge traveling merchants. There were a number of cart drivers carrying goods, coming and going, who often stayed there.\n\nOne evening at dusk a group of four men came up to the door wanting to put up for the night, but the old man’s lodge was already filled up with guests. The four men considered there were no other options and strongly requested to stay. The old man muttered to himself and thought of one place, but worried that it might not meet the approval of the guests.\n\n“Provided there’s a single space even in your halls or under your eaves,” the visitors said, “we wouldn’t ask for anything more.”\n\nAt that time, the wife of the old man’s son had just died. Her corpse lay in a room, his son having gone out to purchase a coffin and not yet having returned. Because the mourning area was quiet, the old man guided them there through a passageway.\n\nIn the room with the corpse, a dim lamp was set on a table; behind the table hung a curtain, and there was a paper bedspread covering the deceased. They looked over the place where they were to sleep on a big bed in the adjoining room. The four visitors were exhausted from their day’s busy travels, so as soon as they laid down on their pillows, their breathing turned to snores. One of the men, however, was still only half asleep.\n\nSuddenly he heard a swishing sound coming from the bed of the deceased. Anxiously opening his eyes, he found that the lamplight shining before the bier revealed everything clearly: the woman’s corpse tore off the coverlet and sat up; soon she left the bier and crept over to where the men were lying. Her face was a slightly jaundiced color and she wore a strip of thin silk tied around her forehead. Lowering herself near the head of the bed, she exhaled three times on the three guests laying there.\n\nThe man was terrified; fearing she was about to reach him, he stealthily covered his head with the bedspread and held his breath to listen for what would happen. Soon the woman took her place and exhaled at him as she had done to the others.\n\nBecoming aware that she had left their room, he then heard the sound of the paper coverlet again. He stuck his head out a bit to spy, and saw her stretched out stiff, as she had been originally. Horribly frightened, the guest dared not make a sound; he covertly prodded the other men with his leg, but they didn’t move a bit. Though lacking a plan, he figured there was no alternative but to throw on his clothes and flee.\n\nNo sooner had he jumped up to pull on his clothes than he noticed that sound again. In terror, the visitor laid down and pulled his head back under the bedspread. He became aware of the woman returning, repeatedly exhaling at him several times, then leaving again.\n\nAfter a while, he heard the noise from the bed, so he knew she was lying down again. Then he inched his hand out from under the bedspread to get his pants, hastily yanked them on, and ran outside barefooted. The corpse also rose up to chase him. By the time it started to move away from the curtain, the guest had unlatched the door and gone outside. The corpse sped after him in pursuit.\n\nThe man ran screaming through the village, but not a person was awakened. He wanted to pound on his host’s door, but he was also fearful of being caught from staying too long in that place. Thereupon he ran as fast as he could go along the road leading away from the village.\n\nOnce he’d made it to the countryside east of town, he spied a monastery, and hearing the sound of a wooden fish, he was quick to rattle the gate. This surprised the monks as something totally unexpected, so they didn’t admit him right away. The corpse, right on his heels, was soon within a _chi_ of him. The man became even more frantic.\n\nOutside the gate was a white poplar, its trunk four or five _chi_ around, so he used the tree as defense; when she went to the left, he’d go to the right, and when she went right, he’d go left. The corpse grew more and more frustrated, but both were now feeling exhausted. The corpse paused while the guest, sweating and out of breath, hid behind the tree. Suddenly she pounced, stretching both arms around the tree to find and attack him. Terrified, he fell down. The corpse proved unable to seize him and stiffened up while hugging the tree.\n\nThe monks listened for a good long time, and upon hearing no further sound, ventured out to see the man lying on the ground. They saw he was near death, like a candle burning out, but his heart was still beating slightly. They carried him in and it wasn’t until the night had passed that he revived. They got him to drink some broth and asked him about himself, giving the visitor time to compose his answers.\n\nBy that time the morning bell had finished ringing, and as the dawn’s colors spread everywhere, the monks were able to sneak a peek at the tree outside—and as a result saw the stiffened corpse of the woman. Greatly astonished, they reported it to the county magistrate.\n\nThe magistrate personally paid a visit to determine the facts. He sent his men to pry off the woman’s arms, but they were so rigid they couldn’t be moved. Examining the corpse carefully, he noticed that four fingers of each hand were curled like hooks and sunk up to the nails into the tree. They tried again with all their strength to pull them loose. Upon succeeding, they found finger holes that looked like they’d been dug in.\n\nThe magistrate dispatched some servants to the old man’s household which was in an uproar since the corpse had disappeared and guests had been killed. The servants reported what had happened. The old man then followed them to retrieve his daughter-in-law’s corpse.\n\nThe guest wept as he wondered aloud to the magistrate, “We four men went out together, and now only I return—what will the people in our home village believe about this?” The magistrate gave the man an official document and bestowed on him sufficient means to pay for his return home.",

One evening, while two maids were looking after his mother as she went to sleep in the main hall, they heard a squirting sound in the courtyard, just like when a tailor sprays water from his mouth onto a cloth before ironing it.\n\nThe mother urged the maids to get up, and when they poked a hole in the window paper they saw an old woman, short and hunchbacked, with broom-bristlely, snow-white hair coiled up on top of her head, about two _chi_ in length, walking around the courtyard in a circle, taking long, quick steps like a crane, spouting water endlessly as she walked. Stunned, the servant girls returned and described it all.\n\nSong’s mother was also startled and got up, the two maidservants helping her to the window where they watched together. The old woman suddenly rushed close to the window, spraying directly inside through the frame, splitting the window paper, and the three women fell down as though dead, though the family members knew nothing of this.\n\nWhen the sun had already been up for awhile in the east, the family members gathered together and knocked at the door, but to their surprise they received no answer. Prying open the door to enter, they saw the mistress and the two maidservants, lying side-by-side in the room, apparently dead.\n\nOne of the servant girls was still warm under the breast. When they helped her up and got her to drink something, she came to her senses and began to give an account of what she had seen. After a while Song arrived, filled with sorrow and anger.\n\nThey checked carefully around the spot where the hag disappeared, while digging more than three _chi_ deep, till some white hair was gradually revealed; they dug further till they found a woman’s corpse that matched what the servant girl had seen, the face as fat and puffy as if she was alive. When they were ordered to strike it, the flesh and bones became all pulpy, as everything inside the skin turned to clear water.",

        "body": "In the capital, Chang’an, there lived a scholar named Fang Dong with a reputation for being quite talented, although his behavior was inappropriately frivolous and discourteous. Every time he caught sight of a woman wandering the streets, he’d follow behind her, without regard to manners.\n\nOn the day before the Qingming festival, he was walking outside the city by chance when he spotted a small carriage with bright red curtains and an embroidered canopy; a number of servant girls followed at a fairly slow pace. Among them, one servant girl, riding a small horse, was radiantly beautiful.\n\nApproaching slightly for a better look, Fang found the carriage curtains open, and inside sat a sixteen-year-old lady in stunning red attire, more exquisite than anyone he had ever seen. His eyes were dazzled, his heart ravished, and he was unable to look away from her—so sometimes from in front and sometimes from behind, he followed at a gallop for quite a number of _li_.\n\nSuddenly he heard the lady ask a servant girl to come near the carriage, saying, “Let down the curtain for me. Where does this crazy young man who keeps peeping at me come from?”\n\nSo the servant girl drew down the curtain and looked at him angrily, saying, “This is the recent bride of the Seventh Lord of the Hibiscus, making a visit to her parents, not some female country bumpkin that a _xiucai_ can outrageously stare at!” With these words, she grabbed some loose dirt from a wheel rut and threw it at him.\n\nIt got in his eyes, so he couldn’t open them. Fang rubbed them in order to take another look, but found the carriage and horses nowhere to be seen. Surprised and bewildered, he returned home.\n\nHe became aware that his eyes weren’t getting any better. He sent for someone who opened his eyelids, poking and examining them, and found a small, cloudy spot growing over each eyeball; through the night it became more severe, causing his eyes to water continually.\n\nThe spot gradually built up and in a few days had become as thick as a coin. A kind of spiral pattern developed on the right eyeball, and no medicine proved effective for it.\n\nAnnoyed and depressed, he wanted to put an end to himself until he began thinking about repenting his misdeeds. He’d heard that the “_guangming_ sutra” would be able to resolve his distress. He got hold of a copy and asked a man to teach him to recite it.\n\nAt first Fang had trouble because he was too impatient, but in time he became more calm. From dawn to dusk he did nothing but work at it, sitting cross-legged while fingering his beads. After having done this for a year, he achieved a state of absolute clarity.\n\nSuddenly from his left eye, Fang heard words as tiny as a fly’s: “It’s so black here it’s unbearable, enough to kill a person!”\n\nFrom the right eye came the reply, “Let’s get out and take a little stroll together since it’s stifling in here.” Soon he began to feel a wriggling on both sides of his nose that made it itch, as if something was coming out of his nostrils, and then went away.\n\nAfter a long time had passed, he felt them come back, returning up his nostrils and entering his eye sockets.\n\nAgain a voice spoke: “It’s been a long time since I had a peek at the garden—the Pearl Orchids are all dried up and dead!” Fang had been very fond of these particular orchids, having planted many of them in his garden and often watering them himself; following his sight loss, however, he hadn’t even inquired about them.\n\nSuddenly, upon hearing these words, he anxiously asked his wife, “How is it that my orchids have withered and died?”\n\nThe wife inquired how he knew this, and he proceeded to inform her about the incident. She hastened away to test this information and found the flowers withered indeed. This seemed very strange to her.\n\nQuietly concealing herself in the room to wait, she saw tiny people, no bigger than beans, appear from inside the scholar’s nose and zip right out the door. They moved further and further away, then vanished from sight. Instantly they linked arms and returned, flying up to his face like bees or ants whizzing into their nests.\n\nThis went on for two or three days. Once again Fang heard a voice from his left side: “It isn’t very convenient coming and going in this winding tunnel, not as good as if we’d open a door.”\n\nThe right side answered, “My wall’s pretty thick, so it’s not going to be easy.”\n\n“I’ll try to open up mine so we can both get through,” said the left. Thereupon Fang felt something like a scratching and ripping in his left eye. Instantly upon opening his eyes to look, he was able to see a table and other things. Full of joy, he informed his wife.\n\nShe examined him and found a little hole torn in the thick cloudiness, through which the dark eye gleamed like a split peppercorn. By the next morning, the opaqueness had disappeared entirely. Upon careful inspection, the pupil could be seen again in one eye, while the old spiral remained over the right eye—so they knew that the people in the two pupils had made their home in the same eye.\n\nFang was blind in one eye now, but comparatively speaking, he could see more clearly than other people using both eyes. Because of this advantage, he became more reflective about his behavior and in his homeland was widely praised for his virtue.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “In a rural area there was a scholar who, along with two friends, was out on the road when in the distance he saw a young woman riding a donkey in front of them, so he jokingly taunted, ‘That’s a beauty there!’\n\n“He turned back and said to his two friends, ‘Let’s catch up with her!’\n\n“They laughed with each other and rode on, soon catching up with the lady. When they did, the scholar saw that she was his own daughter-in-law. Feeling himself blushing and ashamed, he fell silent and had no more to say. The scholar’s friends pretended not to know her and commented on the woman in very vulgar terms.\n\n“The seemingly bashful scholar stammered as he spoke these words: ‘She’s my eldest son’s wife.’ Each of the other men concealed a snicker and dropped the matter.\n\n“Being flippant usually turns into an act of self-insult that’s really self-ridicule. In terms of the dirt that got into Fang’s eyes and caused him to lose his sight, that’s just the vindictiveness of ghosts and supernatural beings. We don’t know which god the Lord of the Hibiscus may be. Is it another physical appearance of a bodhisattva? Yet even if ghosts and supernatural beings are sometimes wicked, they still give people a chance to correct their errors and to make a fresh start.”",

        "body": "Meng Longtan, from Jiangxi province, was visiting the capital with a _juren_ named Zhu. By chance they found themselves at a Buddhist monastery, where neither the hall nor the meditation chambers were particularly spacious or grand, and which was occupied only by a single aged monk. Seeing the visitors, he made his robe look respectable and came out to greet them, then showed them around.\n\nIn the midst of the hall was a statue of Zhigong, a magic monk of the Han dynasty. On either side were murals painted in intricate detail, vividly depicting lifelike human figures. The east mural was of the “Heavenly Maidens Scattering Flowers,” in which a teenage girl picks a flower with a wistful smile, her cherry lips on the verge of opening and the waves in her eyes about to flow. Zhu stared at her for a long time, unaware of how his mind was wandering, until he fell into a trance.\n\nHis body suddenly began floating and fluttering as though sailing on a cloud, till he found himself entering the mural. There he saw countless halls and pavilions totally unlike those in the world of mortals. An aged Buddhist monk sitting on a dais preached the Dharma while a considerable crowd of monks, wearing robes that bared one shoulder, watched. Zhu mixed in and stood amongst them.\n\nSoon, he seemed to feel someone covertly yanking at the front of his garment. He turned to find the mural’s teenage girl. She smiled and walked away. Following her along a winding railing until she entered a small chamber, Zhu then held back, hesitantly, rather than venturing any further.\n\nThe girl turned her head, raising the flower in her hand in a beckoning motion, so he hurried to her.\n\nSince there was no one else inside the quiet chamber, he hastily embraced her, and meeting very little resistance from her, they proceeded to make love. When they were finished, she locked the door and left, advising him not even to cough. Then she returned that evening. This went on for two days.\n\nThe girl’s companions perceived that something was up and searched together until they found him, then made fun of the girl by teasing, “A little guy’s already getting big inside your belly, yet you still wear your hair loose like a virgin?” They held out hairpins and earrings, urgently insisting that she put her hair up. The girl, feeling ashamed, did not speak.\n\nOne of the other girls said, “Sisters all, we mustn’t hang around any longer—otherwise they’ll be unhappy.” Laughing, then, the group went away.\n\nZhu took a good look at the girl, her hair coiled up high while her phoenix earrings dangled low, and with the contrast he found her even more lovely than when she wore her hair down. Checking to be sure no one else was around, he began taking more indecent liberties with her; with her orchid and musky fragrance suffusing his senses, he indulged his pleasures without ceasing.\n\nSuddenly they heard the heavy clomping of boots and something like the clanging of chains; soon there was the vague clamor of arguing. Alarmed, the girl got up and they secretly peered out. They saw an emissary in soldier’s golden armor, his face black as lacquer, holding up chains in one hand and a hammer in the other, with the girls surrounding him.\n\nHe demanded of them, “Is that everyone yet?”\n\n“That’s everyone,” they replied.\n\nThen the emissary said, “If you’re hiding someone from the world of mortals, you’d better make it known or you’ll be sorry about the consequences.”\n\nAgain their voices insisted, “We’re not.”\n\nThe emissary turned his mighty body around and scanned like a hawk hunting for something hidden. It seemed that he intended to conduct a search. The girl was terrified, her face pale as ashes, and in her fright she said to Zhu, “Hurry, you must hide under the bed.” Then she opened a tiny door in the wall and abruptly escaped through it.\n\nZhu lay hidden, hardly daring to breathe. Presently he heard the sound of boots entering the room, then turning to walk back out. Not much later the noise receded into the distance and he began to feel more secure; however, there were still voices speaking as somebody came and went outside the door.\n\nAfter Zhu had been trapped like this for quite a while, his ears began to feel like a cicada was chirping in them, while his eyes felt inflamed. Though the situation was in danger of becoming unendurable, he tried to calm himself while listening and waiting for the girl to return; besides, in addition, he could no longer recollect how he’d come to be there.\n\nAbout that time, Meng Longtan, still standing in the hall, in the twinkling of an eye suddenly could no longer see Zhu, so he asked the old monk what was going on. The monk, smiling, said, “He’s gone away to hear the Law explained.”\n\n“In what place?” inquired Meng.\n\nThe monk answered, “Not far away.” Not long thereafter, the old man tapped the wall with his finger and called out, “Patron Zhu, after taking a stroll for such a long time, why not come back?”\n\nSoon they witnessed an image of Zhu appear on the wall, inclining his ear towards them as he stood there, as if listening for more from them.\n\nThe monk again cried out, “Your associate has been waiting a long time for you.” Thereupon Zhu floated down out of the mural and stood there like a block of wood, his eyes staring wide open and his legs turning weak.\n\nMeng, though extremely shocked, slowly proceeded to question him. Zhu said that while he’d been hiding under the bed, he’d heard some knocks like thunderclaps, so he’d left the room to spy on the cause.\n\nTogether the men searched the mural for the girl holding the flower and they noticed that her hair was coiled up in a spiral, not long and loose like a child’s. Zhu, astounded, bowed down before the old monk and asked him the reasons for this.\n\nSmiling, the monk replied, “The individual creates his own illusions. How can I hope to explain them?”\n\nZhu was demoralized and downcast, while Meng was shaken to his very core and confused. They stood up, then walked down the steps and away from the monastery.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “‘The individual composes his own illusions’: these sound like the words of one who profoundly understands the philosophy and wisdom of Buddhism. When one has indecent thoughts, one will experience an obscene illusion; when one has obscene thoughts, one will experience a horrific illusion. The bodhisattva enlightens the ignorant and uncultured through numerous transformative illusions. Everything comes from a person’s own change of heart. The old monk spoke earnestly, but the young man heard no enlightenment in his words, nor did he give up his mundane life to seek the wisdom of Buddhism without pretension.”",

        "body": "Sun Taibai has said that his paternal great-grandfather studied in Nanshan at the Willow Ravine Monastery. At harvest time he returned to his village, spent about ten days there, and then went back. As he opened the door to his study, he found that dust had collected upon his table and the window to the room was full of spider webs. He asked a servant to clean it up and by evening the room was clean enough for him to have a seat. He swept off the bed and shook out his old bedding, bolted the door, and went to bed as the moon rose and its light filled his window. He tossed about in bed for a little while until everything finally became still.\n\nSuddenly he heard the rumbling of the wind and the creaking of one of the Buddhist monastery’s doors. He figured it must be because one of the monks had failed to shut a gate. Engrossed in his thoughts, Sun’s great-grandfather wandered toward the sound, which was coming nearer to his hut, till abruptly the outside door of his dwelling came open. He became quite suspicious.\n\nHis thoughts were further unsettled as the noise drifted into his study; there was also a sound like that of boots tromping, gradually drawing near his doorstop. In his heart, he began to be afraid. Suddenly the inner door opened up. As he stared at it anxiously, a huge spirit bowed and squeezed in to enter. It leapt forward to stand before his bed, its head nearly touching the roof beam.\n\nIts face was the color of an old gourd; its eyes flashing, it looked around the room and then opened up its gigantic, tub-like mouth to reveal sparse teeth over three _cun_ long. Moving the tongue in its throat, it uttered a cry in a scolding, chattering voice, so the walls rang with the sound.\n\nThe great-grandfather’s dread reached its limit; but he thought about the fact that the space in the room was so limited that there was no place to flee from its power, so he’d have to strike out at it instead. He drew out a knife that he’d hidden under his pillow, hastily raised it and cut right into its belly, making a sound like he was smashing a stone crock. The spirit was greatly enraged and extended its enormous talons, lashing out to seize Sun’s great-grandfather. He managed to draw back just a bit. The spirit instead snatched at and grabbed his quilt, dragged it off the bed, then left angrily. The great-grandfather fell to the ground with the quilt and lay there, wailing in terror.\n\nHis family’s servants arrived with torches and found his door closed as it had been originally, so they pushed through his window and entered—for upon seeing the ravaged state of the room, they’d been utterly terrified. They helped Sun’s grandfather up onto the bed and he began to talk about what had happened.\n\nTogether they checked around, finding the end of the large quilt squeezed into the crevice where the door closed. Opening the door and holding some lights up to examine it, they found that the quilt had been pockmarked like a sieve, and wherever the spirits’ five fingers had touched it, they’d slashed holes into it. After waiting until daybreak, they didn’t dare delay any longer, but carried the great-grandfather’s bookcase and left together.\n\nLater on, they asked a monk about it and he said that they’d encountered no other strange things there.",

He suspected that the woman was from the neighborhood and had come to visit his wife, but then he had second thoughts: for what urgent reason would someone hastily put on such ominous clothing and then walk into someone’s household?\n\nWhile he lay uneasy and puzzled, the woman stepped out from the inner rooms. He carefully examined her and found her age something beyond thirty, her face a swollen yellow, and her features wrinkled in an expression of fear. She hesitated and didn’t leave, then gradually came near the bed where he was resting. He pretended to fall asleep in order to observe what she would do.\n\nAfter a while, the woman lifted up her clothes, stepped up on the bed and pressed down on his stomach, making it feel like she weighed a ton. Though his mind was as clear as usual, when he attempted to raise his hand, it was as if it was tied up; when he tried to lift his leg, it was as if the leg was paralyzed. In his panic he tried to howl for rescue and bitterly discovered that he was unable to utter a sound. The woman used her nose and mouth to sniff the old man’s face, all over his cheekbones, nose, eyebrows, and forehead—he felt the mouth that was cold as ice, and her breath was so cold that it penetrated to the bone. In this urgent predicament, the old man worked out a suitable scheme: he’d wait until she sniffed up to his jaw or cheek, then at once he’d bite her.\n\nNot a minute later, she arrived at his jaw as expected. He used all of his might to bite her cheek and his teeth sank into her flesh. In her suffering and pain the woman tried to pull away, both struggling to get free and weeping aloud. The old man increased the force of his bite. He felt her blood run down his cheek, soaking the side of his pillow.\n\nThey had hardly arrived at this deadlock when suddenly from an outside yard he heard his wife’s voice, so he shouted at once that there was a ghost. In that moment, as he relaxed his mouth to speak, the woman seized the chance to float away.\n\nHis wife rushed over and came inside, didn’t see anything there and laughed that it must have been just a nightmare. The old man related the strange details to her and in addition reported that there was blood, proving that it had all happened. She helped him inspect the premises and they discovered that something like water had leaked in from the roof, flowing down the pillow and soaking into the bed.\n\nThey bent over to sniff it and it had a bizarre, disgusting, fishy smell. The old man then began vomiting violently. After a few days, it was said that he still had the disgusting stink in his mouth.",

One day when he was taking a nap in the daytime, it seemed to him like something had climbed up on his bed, and he began to feel a sensation of his body rising as if it was sailing on a cloud.\n\nIs this some fox spirit teasing me? he wondered.\n\nHe spied something as big as a cat, with yellow fur and a blue-green mouth, crawling towards him from near his feet. It crept slowly, being afraid of waking Sun. It wavered close to his body: one touch paralyzed his foot and leg, while the next made his thigh and hip go flaccid.\n\nJust as it reached for his stomach, Sun suddenly rose up, put his hands on it and caught it, grasping it by the nape of the neck. The thing made nervous yelps since it was unable to escape. Sun urgently shouted for his wife to strap her belt around its waist.\n\nThen as he held the belt by its two ends, Sun laughed, “I’ve heard about your skills at transformation. Now I’ll keep my eyes on you to see how your changes work.” Within seconds of his speaking, the fox suddenly drew in its stomach till it was as thin as a tube and almost managed to slip away.\n\nSun was greatly stunned and with anxious strength bound it tighter till the fox puffed up its stomach round as a bowl, so firm that the belt couldn’t be tightened any further; as soon as Sun relaxed his force a bit, the fox drew in its stomach again. Sun, still worried about it escaping, quickly ordered his wife to kill it.\n\nHis wife panicked, looking high and low, not knowing where his knife was. Sun jerked his head to indicate its location. When he looked back, the belt in his hands was just an empty loop and the fox had disappeared."

When the buckwheat ripened in autumn, he’d cut it down and heap it into mounds on the boundaries between fields.\n\nAt that time there were grain thieves in the neighboring village, so old An advised the tenant farmers to bring their buckwheat to the threshing ground in wheelbarrows by moonlight. Once they left, An stayed behind on guard duty. Resting his head on a spear, he lay down in an open area.\n\nHe had just closed his eyes a bit when suddenly he heard someone trampling the buckwheat, then making the sound of biting and gnawing, so he suspected it must be a thief. Swiftly he raised his head—and there was a huge ghost, well over three meters tall, with red hair and an ominous moustache and beard, already close to An. Terribly afraid and too mortified to think, he jumped up and poked the thing forcefully. The ghost made a sound like thunder and then vanished. Terrified that it might return, he took his spear and got away.\n\nHe met with the tenant farmers on his way home, telling them what he had seen and warning them that no one should go there again. The people, however, didn’t really believe what he was telling them.\n\nThe following day, while the wheat was drying in the sun at the threshing ground, they suddenly heard a sound from the sky. An, startled, cried, “The evil ghost is coming!” Then he ran away, and the other people also fled. More than two hours later, they turned back around and assembled, with old An commanding them to set up with bows or crossbows and then to wait for it.\n\nThe next day, the ghost came around once again. They fired many arrows simultaneously and the thing was scared away. Two or three days passed without it returning.\n\nThe buckwheat had already been stacked up in the storehouse, leaving behind copious amounts of wheat straw, so old An asked the others to collect the straw and pile it up neatly, then he would personally climb up and stamp it down, until the pile accumulated to a certain height.\n\nSuddenly he looked off in the distance and shouted in fright, “The evil ghost is here!” While the people anxiously sought for their bows and arrows, the thing itself rushed at An. As he fell down, it gnawed at his forehead, then left.\n\nThe others went up together to look at him—and there was a section of bone the size of a hand missing from the unconscious old man’s forehead. Carrying him on their backs, they took him back inside his home, where he died. No one ever saw the ghost again. Indeed, nobody knows what kind of ghost it was.",

Since Li knew that the thing hadn’t been there before, he approached to touch and prod it, but immediately knew something was wrong, for it felt horribly like soft flesh. Shocked and repelled, he turned away from it.\n\nAs soon as he turned back to look at it, its four legs began moving and gradually it disappeared inside the wall. In addition, he saw a white stick standing up against the wall, an immaculate luster adorning it. Coming closer, as he leaned upon the stick wearily, it collapsed, then slowly began to penetrate the wall like a snake and disappeared into it.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of Kangxi’s reign, a young man named Wang Junsheng lived and worked in a household as tutor for the family’s children.

        "title": "Sixth Brother Wang",
        "body": "A man named Xu, whose family lived near the northern edge of Zichuan, was a fisherman by trade. Each night he went down to the river, carrying some wine, and drank while he was fishing. As he drank, he’d pour a libation on the ground and kindly say, “May the spirits of those who drowned in the river have this to drink.” He did this so often that it became part of his routine. Other people who fished there came away without catching anything. Only Xu filled his baskets.\n\nOne evening, just as he was drinking by himself, a young man showed up, casually wandering near him on the bank. Xu offered him a drink and he gratefully accepted a share of the wine. Then for the rest of the night, Xu didn’t catch a single fish, so he felt quite disappointed.\n\nThe young man got up and said, “I’ll head down stream for you and drive them here.” Thereupon he breezily drifted away. A little later he returned to report, “The fish are arriving.” As a result, Xu heard sounds like a school of fish on a feeding frenzy. He raised his net and caught quite a few of them, each one of them over a foot long.\n\nOverjoyed, he expressed his gratitude. Since he was about to return home, Xu offered the young man some of the fish as a present, but he wouldn’t accept them, explaining, “Time and again I’ve enjoyed the favors of your good wine, so this trifling thing isn’t worth talking about. If you wouldn’t reject such an offer, I’d like to do this for you more often.”\n\nXu replied, “We’ve only shared drinks for a single night, so why do you say ‘time and again’? If you’re willing just to hang around with me that would be great; but I’m embarrassed that I have nothing to give you to show my feelings.”\n\nWhen Xu asked him his name, he answered, “My family name is Wang, but I don’t have a courtesy name—so when you see me, you can just call me Sixth Brother Wang.” Thereupon they went their separate ways.\n\nThe next day, Xu sold the fish and bought more wine. Later, when he returned to the river bank, the young man was already there, so he cheerfully gave him some of the wine. They drank several cups, then Wang drove the fish for Xu again.\n\nIt was like that for half a year. Then, suddenly, Wang announced to Xu, “It’s been an honor to have known you, and my feelings for you surpass even those for a blood relative. However, the day has come when we must part from each other.” His words were profoundly sad and sorrowful.\n\nAlarmed, Xu asked him for a reason. Wang tried to speak but then faltered and kept on trying until finally he said, “Since we two are so fond of each other, perhaps I can explain without startling you. Now that we’re about to part, there’s no harm in telling you the truth: I’m really a ghost.\n\n“I’ve always had a taste for the wine, and once several years ago, when I was really drunk, I drowned. You’ve been able to catch more fish than anyone else because I’ve been driving them to you secretly in gratitude for the libations of wine you’ve made for the dead.\n\n“Tomorrow my time will expire, and someone else will die so I can be reincarnated. We won’t be able to meet together after this evening, and that’s why I can’t help feeling sentimental now.”\n\nAt first, Xu was very shocked upon hearing this; but since they’d been close for such a long time, his fears went away. He sighed and sobbed, pouring them both some wine as he spoke these words: “Sixth Brother, drink this and don’t be sad. To have met each other and to have to separate so soon is certainly cause for grief, but you’ve already completed your sufferings and now you can escape them, so it’s appropriate that we should celebrate. Being melancholy just doesn’t make sense.” Thereupon the two began drinking freely.\n\n“What person will take your place?” Xu asked.\n\nWang answered, “Elder Brother, if you watch from the riverbank tomorrow, at high noon a woman will try to cross the river but will drown—she’s the one.” Since they could hear the rooster in the village already crowing, they let their tears fall and parted.\n\nThe next day, Xu respectfully waited beside the river in order to witness the strange event. A woman did indeed arrive, holding a baby in her arms, and as she walked close to the river, she fell in. She managed to cast the baby up on the bank, where it flailed its arms and legs, bawling. Time and again she would sink and then resurface until suddenly she climbed out on the bank, dripping wet, and rested on the ground there briefly to catch her breath before gathering up her baby and leaving.\n\nWhile he was witnessing the woman’s drowning, Xu initially didn’t have the heart to watch without hurrying to her rescue, but then realized that she was to be the substitute for Sixth Brother. He determined not to intervene—then the woman pulled herself out, leading him to wonder why Sixth Brother’s words hadn’t come true.\n\nThat night, Xu went to fish at their old spot. Sixth Brother, who was there once again, turned to him and said, “We’re back together now, so for the time being there’ll be no words of farewell.” Xu asked him what was going on. He explained, “That woman had come to be my replacement; but when she fell in, I took pity on the babe in her arms. Though that one person might have been substituted for me, it wouldn’t be right to ruin two lives for one. For that reason, I couldn’t let it happen. There’s no telling when another substitute may happen by the river. Perhaps it’s because the two of us haven’t come to the end of our friendship yet.”\n\nXu was moved by this and declared in praise, “The compassion in your heart may touch even the Emperor of Heaven.” From then on, they were able to continue meeting there as they had originally.\n\nAfter several days, Sixth Brother came again to take his leave. Xu figured that another substitute must have turned up. “Not at all,” Wang said. “My deed of compassion has been recognized by the Emperor of Heaven. Now he’s appointed me to become the Earth God for Wuzhen, in Zhaoyuan county, and I leave in the morning to take up my position. If you don’t wish to forget our friendship, you must come and visit me. Don’t be afraid of any obstructions posed by the long distance.”\n\nXu congratulated him: “Your forthright honesty has made you a god, which comforts my heart greatly. Nevertheless, the paths of men and gods are quite different. Even if there’s no worry about the long distance, how could I find you?”\n\nWang urged him, “Just come, don’t give it another thought.” He reiterated this over and over and then left.\n\nXu returned home and began at once to prepare for a trip to the east. His wife, laughing, said, “That’s a trip of several hundred _li_, and even if there was such a place, I’m afraid you’d only find a dirt idol there that you couldn’t engage in much conversation.”\n\nXu refused to listen and eventually reached Zhaoyuan County. He made inquiries of some of the locals and found that there really was a place called Wuzhen. After having arrived there, he stopped at an inn where he could rest from his travels and asked about the location of the town’s temple. The host seemed rather shaken by this and asked, “You wouldn’t be a visitor named Xu, would you?”\n\n“That’s correct,” Xu replied. “How’d you know?”\n\nThe host asked again, “Your hometown isn’t Zichuan, is it?”\n\nXu answered, “That’s right. But how’d you know?”\n\nThe owner hastily rushed out without answering. Presently, husbands carrying children in their arms, along with married and unmarried women, were peering inside, with many more arriving, crammed together surrounding the wall outside. Xu was even more surprised.\n\nPeople in the crowd then explained to him, “Several nights ago, a dream sent by the Earth God told us that his friend, Xu, would be arriving soon from Zichuan and that we should offer him assistance with expenses and supplies. We’ve been looking forward to your arrival for a long time.” Xu found this strange as well.\n\nThen he went to make an offering at the Earth God’s temple. Xu prayed, “Since we parted, brother, awake or asleep I haven’t been able to get you out of my mind, so I’ve traveled a long way to honor the appointment we made. The dream you made known to the townspeople about treating me generously touches me deeply in my heart. I’m ashamed I have no more handsome gift to offer than this goblet of wine; if you don’t find it too undignified, please drink it as we used to do beside the river.” Once he’d finished paying his respects, Xu burned some paper money. Immediately he saw the wind rise up behind the pedestal of the God’s statue, whirl around for a long time, and then disperse.\n\nThat night he dreamt of Sixth Brother coming to see him, dressed neatly, a considerable change from the ordinary. In gratitude, Wang said, “You’ve journeyed from far away to visit me, and I’m so happy that I can’t hold back my tears. But since I’m in this official position—insignificant though it is—I can no longer meet with you face-to-face, so even though we’re so close to each other now, it feels like the distance between rivers and mountains. This saddens me to the very heart. The townspeople have some modest presents to offer you, to acknowledge our long-standing friendship. When it’s time for you to return home, I’ll come to see you off properly.”\n\nAfter staying for several days, Xu decided to take his leave. The crowd of residents courteously asked him to stay, presenting him with invitations in the morning and requests to entertain him in the evening, throughout the day bringing offers from an increasing number of potential hosts. Xu graciously declined, reiterating his need to be on his way. The crowd then brought armloads of offerings, all vying to present him with their farewell gifts. In less than a morning, the gifts filled an enormous sack. Old and young alike gathered together then to wish him a safe trip and to see him off as he left the village.\n\nAll of a sudden a cyclone of wind rose up, and followed for more than ten _li_ as he went. Xu repeatedly bowed to it, saying, “Sixth Brother, take good care of yourself! Don’t bother keeping up with me. Your benevolent and loving soul will certainly bring good fortune to your people, so you don’t need your old friend to say anything more.” The wind whirled around then for quite some time before moving on. Some of the townspeople who’d been traveling with him, marveling at all of this, also turned back. Xu returned home and became modestly wealthy, so he didn’t have to fish any more.\n\nEver after, whenever he ran into someone from Zhaoyuan, he asked about Sixth Brother Wang, and they reported that his spirit granted whatever his people requested. Others say that he’s actually in Shikeng village, in Zhangqiu County. It’s hard to know which it actually is.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks: “To occupy the position of a high official but not to forget about old friends in humble and destitute circumstances—that’s why Wang could become a god. Today a noble travels in a coach, but will that person still remember old friends he made back when he was a nobody? There is a man without social rank in my village whose family is extremely poor. One of his childhood friends became an official with high rank and salary. The poor man thought, ‘If I trust to his generosity, surely he’ll take good care of me.’ So the poor man packed his belongings and made the arduous journey across a thousand _li_, only to be disappointed. After spending all of his money and selling his horse, he returned home.\n\n“His joker of a brother wrote a _yueling_ that mocked him: ‘This month, my brother returned, his fur cap lost, his umbrella no longer working, his horse exchanged for a donkey, and he won’t be traveling again until his boots stop squeaking.’ Read it for a good laugh.”",

        "body": "Back when I was a teenager, I went to our administrative district to take an examination at the time of the Spring Festival. It’s an ancient custom that on the day before the new year’s eve, every working site and every business shop is decked out in colors and musicians parade to the provincial governor’s office—this is always called “Performing Spring.” I followed some friends to watch the festivities. That day the streets were virtually jammed with wandering people.\n\nAt the head of the court of justice were four officials, each dressed in red, sitting across from each other, two on the east and two on the west. Back then I was still very young and hence wasn’t aware who the officials were. All I could hear was the buzz of people speaking and the clamor of the musicians in my ears.\n\nSuddenly a man appeared, with a long-haired boy following him to convey his possessions on a carrying pole, and stepped up onto the stage, apparently having something to say. There were myriad uproarious sounds in that place, so I couldn’t hear what he was saying. Yet I could see people at the head of the court smiling and laughing.\n\nAt once, a dark-robed person with a loud voice ordered them to give a performance. As the man prepared to deal with this mandate, he inquired, “What shall I perform?” Those at the head of the court conferred with each other. A clerk came down and announced that they wished to see his best. He answered, “I can transpose living things.” The clerk then related this to the officials. Almost immediately, the clerk came down again and directed him to obtain some peaches.\n\nThe performer promised to do so, removed his outer garment and laid it over his bamboo basket, audibly muttering an apparent complaint: “These officials aren’t exactly long on intelligence! The ice hasn’t even started to thaw yet, so how can I get any peaches? If I don’t lay hold of some, I fear these officials will be angry. What now?”\n\nHis son said, “Father, you’ve promised them, so how can you back out?\n\nThe conjurer seemed pretty melancholy for a long time before finally declaring, “I’ve calculated and keep coming back to the same conclusion. It’s spring, but the first snow’s still on the ground—so how’s someone supposed to go about searching for something like this? Only in the orchard of the Queen Mother of the West, where the four seasons never change and nothing ever withers or drops its leaves, might there be some. One would have to steal them from heaven above. It’s the only way.”\n\nHis son blurted, “Huh! You going to climb a stairway to heaven?”\n\n“I have certain skills,” he replied.\n\nThen he opened his bamboo basket, took out a coil of rope about a hundred feet long, held an end, looked up and flung it skywards; at once the rope stood suspended in mid-air, as if it were hanging from something. Nor was that all, for the more he flung, the higher it went, until it disappeared into the clouds and the rope in his hands also came to an end. Next he shouted to his son, “Get over here! I’ve old and worn out, my body’s too heavy and clumsy. I can’t go up there, so you’ll have to be the one.” Consequently he passed the rope to his son and said, “Hang on to this and up you go.”\n\nThe son took the rope with a disgruntled expression, grumbling, “Old man, you must be totally crazy! With this excuse for a rope, you want me to hang on and climb several thousand feet to high heaven. If it happens to snap somewhere along the way, not even my skeleton will survive!”\n\nSobbing violently and patting him, his father said, “I made a slip of the tongue and I regret I can’t withdraw it. Don’t make it worse—just go. If you steal one and bring it back, surely they’ll grant us hundreds in gold, enough for you to marry a beautiful woman.” His son then grabbed onto the rope and twisting in a circle, he climbed up, hands sliding and feet following like a spider on its silk, till gradually he passed through some clouds and could no longer be seen.\n\nAfter a while, a peach the size of a large bowl fell from the sky. The joyful conjurer held it on display for the officials there. At the head of the hall they studied it for a very long time, unable to determine whether it was genuine or a fraud.\n\nAll of a sudden the rope fell to the ground from above and the conjurer, alarmed, cried, “How terrible! Up there, someone’s cut our rope, so there’s nothing for him to hang onto!” A moment later, something else fell from above. One glance told them that it was the son’s head. Cradling it in his arms and sobbing, he said, “It must have been for stealing the peach, when some guard became aware of what he’d done. It’s the end of my boy!”\n\nAs more time passed, a leg dropped from above; nor was that all, as the limbs of his dismembered body fell down until there were no more left to recover. Overwhelmed by grief, the conjurer picked up the pieces one by one, put them in his bamboo basket and shut it, then said, “I’m an old man and had only this one son, who followed me everywhere I traveled. Now having carried out my strict orders, he’s suffered this bizarre and cruel fate! I must carry this away and bury him.”\n\nThen he walked up to the officials’ table, knelt, and cried, “For that peach, my son was killed! If you have pity for a working man and will help me bury him, I’ll pledge to repay your kindnesses even after death.” The shocked officials sat there, stunned, and each one bestowed some gold on him.\n\nThe conjurer received their gifts, wrapped them up and bound them around his waist, then rapped on his bamboo basket and shouted, “Beloved son, you should come out and give thanks for these gifts. What’re you waiting for?” Suddenly a boy with disheveled hair pushed up the lid of the basket with his head and bowed it in the direction of the officials—thus revealing himself to be the conjurer’s son.\n\nSuch was that strange feat of magic, it still comes back to me in my memory. Afterwards I heard that the White Lotus Cult had the ability to practice such skills. Is it possible that the conjurer was one of their practicing descendants?",

        "title": "Sowing Pears",
        "body": "A certain villager was selling his extremely sweet, fragrant pears in the marketplace at sky-high prices when a Daoist priest wearing a worn-out scarf and cotton clothing came before his cart and begged for one. The villager cried out angrily at him, but couldn’t drive him away; incensed, the villager cursed him even more strongly.\n\nThe Daoist priest replied, “There are several hundred pears in your cart—I’m only begging for one, a modest request that would cause you no great harm, so why become angry?” The bystanders encouraged the villager to give the Daoist one of his pears that’d gone off and then send him away, but the villager refused to go along with the suggestion. In the midst of this a hired laborer, unable to endure the noisy conflict, took some of his money and bought a pear, then handed it over to the Daoist.\n\nThe priest bowed his thanks and declared to the crowd, “We Daoists don’t understand miserliness. I now have a nice quality pear and will bring it out to share with all of you here.”\n\nSomebody asked, “Since you’ve got a nice pear, why don’t you eat it yourself?”\n\nHe replied, “I needed this fruit’s seeds to grow others.” Thereupon he held the pear in both hands and devoured it. When he finished, he took the seeds in his hand, rearranged his clothing so he could use a spade, dug into the soil to a depth of several inches, inserted the seeds and then covered them with earth. Facing the people in the marketplace, he asked for some warm water to irrigate them and to make them fertile. Some mean-spirited volunteer thereupon approached a nearby shop to get some boiling water—which the priest received and poured over the hole he’d made.\n\nThe eyes of the gathered crowd looked on, witnessing sprouts poke out and gradually get larger; in an instant, they formed a tree with branches supporting lush foliage; suddenly there were flowers, and just as suddenly, enormous and incredibly fragrant fruit filled the entire tree. The Daoist priest then reached to the top of the tree and plucked them off, bestowing them on the observers so they ran out in no time at all.\n\nNext he vigorously chopped away at the tree, contending with it for quite a while, eventually cutting it down; then he put the leafy load over his shoulder, and slowly walked away with it.\n\nThroughout this exercise of the Daoist’s arts, the villager had been standing in the midst of the assembled crowd, craning his neck and straining his eyes, meanwhile forgetting all about his business. Once the priest was gone, he turned to look into his cart and found it completely empty of pears. He then realized that the pears that had been so generously distributed in that place had all been his.\n\nUpon inspecting his cart carefully he found one of its handles gone, having been recently sheared through and cut off. His heart filled with anger and hatred.\n\nEager to catch up with the priest, he tore past the corner of a wall and found his handle discarded at its base, at that moment recognizing it as the trunk of the pear tree that had been chopped down. There was no sign of the Daoist priest anywhere. Everyone in the marketplace smiled broadly.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The villager was so incredibly stupid, his foolishness was almost something you could consider endearing. No surprise, then, that he saw the marketplace people grinning at him. One often sees that when villagers who have no official titles, and are considered rich locally, are asked by a good friend for some rice, they won’t do what’s right—indeed, calculating before replying, ‘That’s several days’ earnings there.’ Or if they’re encouraged to help those threatened by disaster, or to prepare a meal for a lone, solitary person, again resenting what is right, calculatedly say, ‘That’s enough food for five or ten people.’\n\n“At the worst, fathers and sons, elder brothers and younger brothers, all exhaust themselves in the settling of trifling money matters. When their hearts are driven mad with gambling lust or sexual desire, however, in an instant they’re no longer stingy; or when the sword is about to come down on their necks, they’ll pay to buy their own lives back without hesitation. But individuals in such categories are too numerous to list separately, so the example of such a foolish villager is anything but a surprise.”",

        "title": "The Daoist of Laoshan",
        "body": "A scholar named Wang lived in our county, the seventh son in a large, wealthy family. From the time he was small, he’d admired the magical arts of Daoism, so hearing news that there were many immortals living on Laoshan, he set out wandering with a bamboo bookcase on his back.\n\nAscending to the summit, he saw a monastery there, very remote and serene. A Daoist priest was sitting cross-legged on a mat of rushes, his white hair hanging down his neck, wearing a look of radiant openness. Wang kowtowed and spoke with him, the priest’s words proving both wise and mysterious. He asked if the priest would become his teacher.\n\nThe Daoist answered, “I’m afraid from your fragile and indolent appearance that you’d be unable to bear the necessary suffering.”\n\nWang insisted, “I can do it.”\n\nThe Daoist had many disciples who came together at twilight. Wang kowtowed to all of them and succeeded in being allowed to stay at the monastery.\n\nAs the morning sun rose, the Daoist priest called for Wang to get an axe, sending him out with the many others to select and collect firewood. Wang solemnly listened, doing as he was instructed. After a month of this, he developed thick calluses on both hands and feet, could no longer endure his hardships, and began nurturing a private desire to return home.\n\nOne evening he returned to see two visitors drinking together with his master. Though the sun had already given way to dusk, still no lamps or candles had been lit. The master then cut paper with scissors to form a mirror shape and pasted it to the wall. In an instant the room glowed with the bright splendor of the moon, a brightness sufficient to reveal even the finest hairs or corn silks. All the disciples heard about this and rushed to the room.\n\nOne of the visitors said, “It’s a fine night to enjoy the sublimely beautiful together.” The Daoist reached for a wine jar on the table and gave it to his disciples, urging them to drink all they could. Wang considered to himself: how can seven or eight people all get enough from just one wine jar?\n\nThen each of them looked for something suitable to drink from, vying to be the first to drain a goblet for fear that the wine would run out; but as they kept pouring from it time and time again, it didn’t seem to be reduced even a little. Wang felt this was very strange.\n\nSuddenly one of the guests spoke up: “Thank you for granting us the bright, shining light of the moon—it’s just that it’s kind of lonesome drinking wine by itself. Why not call the moon goddess to come down here?” Taking a chopstick, the Daoist proceeded to fling it into the center of the paper moon.\n\nThey saw a beautiful lady emerge from the midst of the rays. At first not even quite a foot tall, by the time she reached the ground she was equal in size to a regular person. With her tiny waist and elegant neck, she lightly performed the “rainbow skirt dance.” And then she sang,\n\nAs I dance airily,\n\nI must either return to the mortal world\n\nOr remain secluded in the icy Moon Palace!\n\nHer voice was exceedingly clear, as resonant as the notes of a xiao flute.\n\nHaving finished her song, she spun around and rose up, jumping up onto the table, and with everyone looking at her in surprise, she turned herself into a chopstick again.\n\nThe three men roared with laughter. Again one of the visitors spoke: “This evening has been perfectly enjoyable, but the wine’s potency is getting to me. Would you agree to have a farewell drink with me in the Moon Palace?”\n\nThe three men relocated their banquet, gradually, to the center of the paper moon. The crowd of disciples gazed upon them sitting there, drinking, their beards and eyebrows totally visible as if images in a mirror.\n\nAfter some time, the moon grew dark; a disciple, however, brought a candle. The Daoist priest was discovered sitting alone as normal, the guests long gone. The leftovers from earlier were still in dishes on the table, but the moon on the wall was now just a piece of paper shaped like a circular mirror.\n\nThe Daoist asked his disciples, “Have you had enough to drink?”\n\n“Quite enough,” they replied.\n\n“If so, then you’d better get to bed—you won’t be able to collect firewood if you’re not rested.” The group promised they would do so and withdrew. Wang was secretly both happy and jealous, so he stopped thinking about going back home.\n\nBut a month later, the suffering was once again more than he could bear, and the Daoist priest hadn’t passed a single magical technique on to him. Feeling he could wait no longer, he resigned his duties and said, “As a pupil, I journeyed a hundred _li_ to study with you, an immortal teacher, so even if I can’t obtain the skill of being immortal myself, perhaps there’s some small technique you could pass on to me. This would also ease my mind of its desire for instruction. Looking over these last two or three months, it’s no exaggeration that the only thing I’ve done as a pupil in your school is to collect firewood from dawn till dusk, the kind of hardship I never knew at home.”\n\nThe Daoist smiled, saying, “I originally said you wouldn’t be able to handle the suffering, and now it seems I was right. Tomorrow morning I think I will release you to go.”\n\n“I’ve toiled as your pupil for many days,” Wang replied. “Master, if you teach me a bit about one little trick, it won’t all have been a waste.”\n\nThe Daoist asked, “What skill do you seek?”\n\n“I’ve seen that when you walk, walls cannot stop you,” Wang said. “Merely to obtain the method for this would be enough.” The Daoist smiled his permission. He provided a rhyming chant for Wang to use, commanded him to repeat the incantation, and then shouted: “Enter the wall!”\n\nWang faced the wall, but didn’t dare attempt to enter it.\n\nAgain the priest exclaimed, “Try it now.” Wang, though determined and unhurried, came up to the wall and then stopped.\n\nThe Daoist said, “Put your head down and plow into it, don’t shrink from it!”\n\nWang resolutely moved back from the wall several steps, then ran right at it; when he reached the wall, it was as if nothing were there. He turned back to inspect it, and consequently found himself on the other side of the wall. Greatly pleased, he went back through the wall to the other side and thanked his teacher.\n\n“When you return home,” the Daoist said, “maintain an appropriate purity of action, or the incantation won’t prove effective.” Thereupon he provided Wang with some money to pay for his return journey and sent him on his way.\n\nArriving home, Wang bragged that he’d met an immortal, and solid walls were no longer able to stop him.\n\nHis wife didn’t believe him.\n\nWang made ready to perform, backing away from the wall several steps, then sprinted, his head striking the wall—bouncing off, however, and causing him to fall.\n\nHis wife pulled him up and looked him over, found a bump swelling on his forehead, and informed him of the large, egg-sized lump there. She ridiculed him. Wang was ashamed and angry, and cursed the old Daoist priest for being so mean to him.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Those who hear of this episode can’t help but roar with laughter; but if so, they must not be aware of all the scholar Wangs in this world, who are not exactly few in number. Take, for instance, a crude official, the kind who’s happy to choke down poison but afraid of taking medicine: suddenly some brown-noser boisterously proclaims the power of the official’s skill in order to flatter him, repeating the official’s advice to ‘Stick to what’s worked in the past and you can use it to run wild with impunity.’ When first practiced on some naïve individual, this kind of approach might have no small effect. So then the official would claim it could be applied to affairs worldwide. This kind of person will inevitably meet an impassable wall somewhere and fall heavily to the ground.”",

        "title": "The Changqing Monk",
        "body": "In Changqing, there was a Buddhist monk who had followed the Way in admirable purity. Though more than seventy years old, he was still quite healthy. One day he fell down and couldn’t get back up. The monastery’s other monks rushed over to help him, but he had already passed away. The old monk, however, didn’t realize he was dead, and so his soul began floating away until it finally reached Henan.\n\nIt happened that the son of certain Henan gentry was riding at the head of more than ten mounted servants, who were carrying hawks for rabbit hunting. His horse suddenly broke away and threw him, killing the man. The monk’s soul passed by just about that time, and merged with the young man, who thereupon began to revive.\n\nThe servants anxiously asked him how he felt. He opened his eyes wide, wondering, “How did this happen?” The group then helped him get home.\n\nOnce he was inside the door, a frenzied crowd of powdered and painted ladies surrounded him, examining and asking about him. Greatly startled, he cried, “I’m a Buddhist monk! How did this happen?”\n\nHis family members thought he’d gone crazy and together tried to bring him to his senses. The monk didn’t try to explain himself, simply shutting his eyes without answering them. If they brought him millet he would eat, but if it was wine or meat, he’d refuse. At night he slept alone, not accepting the favors of wives or concubines.\n\nSeveral days later, he suddenly decided to take a little walk. Everyone was cheered by this. As soon as he stepped out, however, a group of servants with financial account books immediately crowded around him, prevailing upon him to look them over. Using the excuse of being sick and tired, he managed to avoid dealing with them.\n\nHe then asked the servants, “Do you know if there’s a Changqing county in Shandong?”\n\n“Certainly,” they all replied.\n\n“I’m depressed here with nothing to do,” he said, “so I’d like to take a trip. Assemble everything I’ll need at once.” They tried to tell him that since his condition had only recently improved, he shouldn’t try to deal with traveling to such a distant place. He wouldn’t hear of it, so they set out the next day.\n\nArriving at Changqing, the monk found things to be as they previously had been. He hadn’t even been bothered by having to inquire how to find his way there, en route to the monastery. A number of his former disciples noticed this was an honored guest and bowed to him most respectfully.\n\nHe then asked them, “What happened to the old monk who used to be here?”\n\n“Our Master’s shell has returned to nature,” they told him.\n\nHe inquired about the grave. The group led him to a grave there that was mounded about three feet high, where the wild grass had not yet grown over it. The monks had no idea what his intentions were.\n\nSoon he called for his horse so he could return home, instructing his former disciples, “Your Master lived piously as a monk. The personal items he left behind should be guarded faithfully. You must not allow anything to harm them.” The monks assured him they would do so, and he left.\n\nOnce he was back home, he sat, pale and lethargic, refusing to take charge of any of the family’s business.\n\nLiving this way for several months, finally he slipped out the gate to escape and went straight back to the old monastery where he called out to his disciples, “It’s me, your Master.” The monks were extremely skeptical, exchanging glances with each other and scoffing. So he related to them how his soul had returned, then described what his life with them in the monastery had been like, till it all fit together. With his disciples convinced at last, he occupied his old dais once again and resumed his daily routines.\n\nAfterwards, the young master’s family sent horses and sorrowful requests that he return, which he refused even to acknowledge. When more than a year had gone by, the young master’s wife sent a responsible servant with many gifts to leave there. He turned away the gold and silk, keeping for himself only a simple cloth robe. Some of his friends once went to Changqing and paid him a respectful visit, discovering that he had become quiet and sincere. Though he appeared to be only about thirty years old, he often spoke of events that had taken place over eighty years earlier.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “When a person dies, the soul scatters, and though a thousand _li_ apart from the body, it doesn’t just disperse if its owner was an individual of devout character. Concerning the monk, I’m not at all surprised that he returned to life again, though what _is_ surprising to me is that he entered into a life of splendor and luxury and was unable to refuse or to escape from it. A single glance can bring about a seduction, or one can find a seduction impossible to achieve despite one’s most vigorous efforts—think where this leaves the monk!”",

        "title": "The Snake Man",
        "body": "In East Prefecture, there was a certain fellow who trained snakes to perform for a living. He once raised and trained two snakes together, both entirely green: he called the larger one Big Green, the smaller one, Green the Second. Green the Second had a red-spotted forehead and was especially clever and cooperative, invariably winding and swaying just as he wished it to do. The snake man took a special fancy to it, favoring it over his other snakes.\n\nAfter a year passed, Big Green died, and though the trainer thought about trying to fill its vacancy, he could never find the time to do so. One night, he stayed at a monastery in the mountains. At daybreak, he opened his bamboo basket and Green the Second was nowhere to be seen. The snake man was so bitterly disappointed, he wanted to die.\n\nHe searched high and low, calling out for Green the Second, but there was no sign of the snake. Previously, whenever they would pass through a grove with abundant grass, he always let it out so it could enjoy itself, and it would return again when he went to look for it; on this occasion, he hoped, of course, for the same result.\n\nHe sat and waited until the sun was high in the sky and he was worn out from watching, then, dispirited, he finally left. He’d only gone a few steps out the monastery’s door when he distinctly heard something inside a pile of kindling, making the sound of a snake’s hissing.\n\nHe froze in his tracks, startled, and looked back at it: there was Green the Second. He was overjoyed—it was like he’d found a huge piece of jade. He stopped to set his load down at the side of the road and Green the Second also stopped suddenly. The snake man noticed that a little snake was also following behind them. Petting Green the Second, he said, “I was afraid you’d gone for good. Is this your little buddy?”\n\nThe snake man took out some treats for it and for the little snake as well. The little snake, however, wouldn’t move towards them, being so timid and frightened that it wouldn’t venture near the food. Green the Second took some in its mouth to feed it, in the same way that a host might offer some to a guest. The snake man also offered it some more, and it ate that, too. Once it had been fed, it followed Green the Second into the basket.\n\nHe carried it back with him and taught it to gyrate and sway, and always to be well-behaved. Soon it was no less trained than Green the Second, and for that reason he named it Little Green. Showing off their talents everywhere he went, he raked in more money than he could count.\n\nGenerally speaking, snake men work with snakes only until the creatures are about two feet long, for any larger than that they become too heavy and require substitutes. Since Green the Second was so well-trained, the snake man was reluctant to replace him. In another two or three years, it grew well over three feet long and when coiled would fill the entire bamboo basket, and hence he determined to let it go.\n\nOne day, standing at Zibo’s East Mountain, he fed it some especially nice treats, wished it all the best, and then released it. He turned around an instant later and found it had come back and was coiled around the bamboo basket. The snake man waved at it and cried, “Go on! Everything in the world comes to an end, even if it’s lasted a hundred years. If you conceal yourself in the valleys here, surely in time you’ll become a dragon spirit. A bamboo basket can’t hold you forever, can it?”\n\nGreen the Second then left indeed. The snake man watched until it was gone. Then it came back again and wouldn’t leave despite his attempts to shoo it away, but kept bumping its head against the bamboo basket. Little Green was inside, and it was also upset and agitated.\n\nThe snake man became aware of the problem and asked, “Didn’t you get to bid Little Green farewell?” Then he let him out, and Little Green went straight to his friend. They put their heads together and flicked their tongues out, apparently speaking to each other. In no time the snakes were crawling off together, side by side. Just when he was beginning to wonder whether Little Green was coming back, it returned, slithering in by itself, until it had entered all the way into the bamboo basket and curled up.\n\nFrom that point he began searching for a snake of comparable quality, but couldn’t find one so excellent. And then Little Green began growing steadily until it was unable to perform any longer. Eventually he did find one that was quite docile, though it certainly wasn’t as talented as Little Green. And Little Green had become as thick as a child’s upper arm.\n\nAt first, Green the Second settled in the mountains and firewood gatherers often spotted it there. Over the years it grew several feet long and as big around as a bowl; it also began to chase after people and for that reason travelers started warning each other not to venture into its territory.\n\nOne day, the snake man was passing through that vicinity when a snake suddenly and violently came after him like a gust of wind. The snake man was quite scared and fled. The snake was swift in its pursuit. When he turned back to look at it he saw it was about to catch him. But when he glanced at its head, he noticed those familiar red spots and quickly realized it was Green the Second. He put down his belongings and cried out, “Green the Second! Green the Second!”\n\nThe snake came to a sudden halt. It held its head high for a long time, then wound its body around the snake man, as it had in the past when they were performing. He sensed that it wished him no harm whatsoever, but the human body can only take so much weight, so all its winding wasn’t very pleasant; he fell to the ground, gasping and praying, and thereupon he was released.\n\nThen it bumped its head against the bamboo basket. The snake man understood what it wanted, opened the bamboo basket and out came Little Green. The two snakes exchanged glances, then wrapped themselves around each other like candy confections and stayed that way for quite some time before parting.\n\nThe snake man then gave his blessing to Little Green: “For a long time I’ve been thinking about setting you free, and now here’s your buddy.”\n\nTo Green the Second, he said, “You first led him here, so you should also lead him away. And there’s one more thing I have to say to you: deep in the mountains you have no shortage of food and drink, so don’t go troubling people—it offends heaven and you’ll be condemned for it.” The two snakes were crestfallen, as though they had both received the rebuke. Then they hastily slithered off, the big one in front and the little one behind, through the forest which parted for them as they passed. The snake man stood there for a long time, watching them until he could no longer see for sure which way they’d gone.\n\nSince then, people go there all the time, but no one knows where the two snakes went.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Snakes, which may seem like stupid creatures, as it turns out feel affection and have human-like reasoning behind their actions. In addition, they can take criticism and listen to advice readily. Thus it seems hard to justify that there are people who take ten years to become friends with someone else, or several lifetimes to show humble gratitude toward a superior, most of the time thinking badly of those friends and superiors, either adding to the troubles they’ve already suffered or treating them with crazy hostility. They should feel themselves shamed by these two snakes.”",

They ran into an enormous python while the elder brother was going first, so it began swallowing him; the younger brother was so terrified that he wanted to run away, but seeing his elder brother being devoured, he roused himself in anger, took up their woodcutter’s axe and chopped at the snake’s head. Although he wounded it there, it wouldn’t stop its swallowing.\n\nAlthough the elder brother’s head had already been swallowed, it was his good fortune that the snake was unable to get past his shoulders. The younger brother, at wit’s end and unable to come up with a better plan, then grabbed the elder brother’s two feet in his hands and with all his force dragged his elder brother out of the python’s mouth.\n\nDue to its own suffering, the python went away.\n\nUpon inspecting the elder brother, the younger brother discovered that his nose and ears had been entirely digested and he could barely breathe. He carried him away on his shoulders, having to stop along the way ten times or more before arriving home.\n\nMedicines were administered to the elder brother for half a year before he recovered. To this day one can still see every scar on his face and the holes where his nose and ears used to be. Alas!\n\nUnexpectedly, it was among farm folk that there was such a good younger brother! One could even say, “The python didn’t consume the elder brother because it was touched by the younger one’s virtue and righteousness.” Believe it!"

        "title": "The Adulterous Dog",
        "body": "In Qingzhou, there was a merchant named Jia who traveled out away from home, and was frequently gone for a whole year at a time before returning. His household owned a white dog which his wife trained to have sex with her, and the dog made a habit of doing it with her constantly.\n\nOne day, Jia arrived home and that night he and his wife went to lie down in bed together. The dog suddenly rushed in, jumped up on the bed, and mauled the merchant to death.\n\nAfterwards, word got out to other village residents, who were collectively outraged and reported it to their local official. The official shackled the wife, who refused to acknowledge her guilt, and imprisoned her. He ordered the dog tied up and brought in, then summoned the woman to appear as well.\n\nWhen the dog saw her, it came right up and ripped off her clothes, ready to start humping her. There was no longer anything the woman could say except to confess her guilt. Two servants were sent to transfer them to the divisional court, one to accompany the woman and the other the dog. There were onlookers who wanted to see the two perform sexually, and hence they collected money to bribe the servants, who then would lead the dog over to the woman so they could have sex together. Wherever they stopped, they routinely attracted hundreds of people to watch, netting the servants a hefty profit.\n\nUltimately, the woman and the dog were executed by being dismembered an inch at a time. Alas! With the world as big as it is, even the weirdest things can happen somewhere. But was this woman alone in her desire to have intercourse with an animal?\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Those who engage in illicit sexuality in a notorious place must expect to be censured for it; but even a rendezvous in such a place is to be scorned. This was a woman who couldn’t bear to live without sex and thought about intercourse all the time. At night the one lying on her turned out to be an animal from her own household. She made the dog her lover, and it mounted her under the covers.\n\n“At the place of their lovemaking, the dog’s tail wags back and forth. With the beast inside her warmth and softness, the woman moves her waist sweetly. The truth eventually comes out when she opens her thighs and uncovers its tool—then gives in as it returns the shaft to its target, which swallows its length to the root. To take to the idea of bestiality suddenly is really warped.\n\n“The dog, which should guard against adulterers, turned out to be an adulterer itself. Then it became a murderer because of its jealousy. It’s difficult to apply the laws of the government to punish its guilt. The woman, who was not an animal, turned out to have a truly bestial mind and engaged in filthy, stinking copulation with it. Even the jackals and the tigers would refuse to eat her flesh.\n\n“Alas! As the human being involved in this adultery, the woman should be cut an inch at a time; but when it comes time for the adulterous dog to be punished, there’s no way to sentence it with the laws of the mortal world. Since a human being transgressed, the law should ideally punish that person by turning her into a dog; but when the dog transgressed, even the underworld couldn’t find a way to punish it. It would be better to dismember the dog and leave its spirit unable to rest—then its spirit could be arrested and brought before the Hell King for sentencing.”",

        "body": "Wang Mengzhen, whose style name was Yuncang, arrived to take up an official appointment in the area of Chu. He planned first to hike up Longhu Mountain to visit a Daoist master. When he came upon a lake, no sooner had he stepped into a boat than a smaller boat came near and the man piloting it requested to see the official. Wang met with him, noting his lean and muscled appearance.\n\nThe boatman took a name card out of his robe and gave it to Wang, explaining, “The Daoist master heard news that someone in an official’s position was approaching, so I was dispatched to deliver an invitation to him.” Wang was surprised that they knew in advance, like the gods, of his coming, but he took this in good faith and so they departed.\n\nThe Daoist master treated everyone with equal respect. His servants, who all had broad faces and long beards, weren’t dressed like common people. The servant who had been dispatched to meet Wang also served there and stood at the master’s side. He paused, faced the Daoist, and spoke to him in a low, confidential, tone.\n\nReferring to the servant, the Daoist then said to Wang, “This gentleman is your fellow countryman—don’t you recognize him?”\n\nThe official asked who he was and the Daoist replied, “He’s the one your world calls the Hail God, Li Zuoche.” The official was so stunned he couldn’t control the change in his facial expression. “Just now,” the Daoist master commented, “he received an edict from heaven to make it rain and hail, so he’ll have to say goodbye to you right away.”\n\n“Where’s it going to fall?” Wang asked.\n\n“At Zhangqiu,” was the reply.\n\nConcerned about the safety of Zibo, which was near Zhangqiu, Wang left his place at the table and begged for his hometown to be excused from the Hail God’s mission.\n\nThe Daoist master explained, “This is an edict from the Jade Emperor above. The amount of hail is fixed in quantity—who has the authority to reduce it?” Wang was beside himself with worry.\n\nThe Daoist master pondered this for a very long time, then turned to his servant and advised him, “You could channel the rain and hail into the gorge without hurting the corn in the fields.” He further noted, “The guest of honor is already seated; when you leave, try not to be so disruptive.”\n\nThe god then went out into the courtyard, where mist suddenly materialized around his feet, spreading magically over the ground. Soon he flew up into the sky to the height of the trees in the courtyard; continuing, he soared up past the rooftops of its buildings. Then a thunderclap sounded as the god flew swiftly to the north, shaking the court so violently that bamboo mats and other items waved liked fans.\n\n“His departure’s making it thunder!” cried out the startled Wang.\n\nThe Daoist master replied, “This was a mild departure, since I warned him; otherwise, he’d disappear just as the wind was making an enormous sound.”\n\nResigned, the official left to return home, recording the date and sending someone to Zhangqiu to inquire about the hail there. It turned out to be true that there was a huge rain and hail storm on that date that filled every irrigation canal and ditch—while in the farm fields, barely any accumulated at all.",

        "body": "Minister Yin of Licheng, a high-level official, was impoverished in his youth, but had a reputation for boldness. In his hometown there was an estate owned by a formerly prosperous family that spread over several _mu_, with multi-story buildings joined together at the eaves into quite an expanse. But because weird things kept happening there, no one had occupied the premises in a long time; it gradually became so overgrown with wormwood that even in the daytime no one would risk going in there.\n\nIt happened that Yin was joining some scholar friends for a drink when someone playfully said, “If anyone has the nerve to spend a night there, we’ll all pool our money to put on a feast for him.”\n\nYin jumped up and said, “It can’t be that tough!” He snatched up a mat and walked out.\n\nThey all accompanied him to the entrance and then taunted him, “We’ll wait here for a little while, so if you see anything, you can just cry out to us.”\n\nHe smiled. “If there are any ghosts or foxes, I’ll catch them as proof for you.”\n\nUpon entering, he noticed tall weeds obscuring the paths and dense growths of wormwood and mugwort. It was the time of the first quarter of the moon, which fortunately projected a dim yellow light, enabling him to distinguish the locations of doors. Feeling his way with his hands, he proceeded past several doors until he arrived at the furthest building. He stepped up to the moon-viewing platform, which was so bright and clean that he decided to stop right there. To the west he saw the moon shining, though it graced the hill with only a single thread of light.\n\nHe sat there a long time, noticing nothing strange, laughing in secret at the ridiculous rumors that had been circulated. Putting his mat down on the platform and resting his head on a stone, he lay down to gaze at the Cowherd and the Weaving Maid.\n\nAt nearly ten o’clock, as he was feeling drowsy and about to fall asleep, he heard the sound of someone walking around noisily in the building below, then coming upstairs. He surreptitiously peeked while pretending to be asleep, seeing a person in dark clothing carrying a lotus lantern, who suddenly noticed Yin with fright and quickly withdrew. This person said to someone standing behind him, “There’s a stranger here.”\n\nFrom below came the question, “Who is it?”\n\n“I don’t know,” he replied.\n\nPresently an old man came up, proceeded to take a good look at him, and said, “This is Master Yin, a governmental secretary, who’s fallen fast asleep. We can go about our business and since he’s an easy-going, unpretentious gentleman, he won’t make any trouble for us.” So they came in together and opened up all of the doors.\n\nIn a little while, increasing crowds of people were bustling about. The buildings were illuminated by so many lamps that it looked like daytime. Yin rolled over on his side briefly, sneezed and coughed. The old man heard him wake up, came over to him and knelt, saying, “I have a daughter who’s getting married this very evening. Since I didn’t mean to offend you, your honor, I hope you won’t look too harshly on my disturbing you.”\n\nYin stood up, helped the old man up, and replied, “I had no idea that such a joyous ceremony would be held tonight, and I’m ashamed I have no gift to offer in congratulations.”\n\nThe old man said, “It’s our good fortune that your honor’s very presence here will drive away any evil spirits. If I could trouble you to come and participate with us, I’d feel doubly favored by your generosity.” Yin happily agreed to do so.\n\nUpon entering the building, he saw that it was exquisitely decorated. Then a woman, about forty years old or so, came out to pay her respects to him. The old man explained, “This is my wife.” Yin bowed respectfully to her, clasping his hands together.\n\nInstantly, they heard the sound of a sheng’s boisterous music, and someone rushed in, crying, “He’s here!” The old man hastened out to meet the arrival while Yin also stood up to wait for him. In a few minutes, a cluster of people carrying gauze-covered lanterns led in the bridegroom. He was seventeen or eighteen years old, graceful and handsome.\n\nThe old man directed him first to pay respects to their wedding’s honorable guest. In deference, the young man looked over at Yin, who responded graciously with the manner of an attendant representing the host. Next the old man and the son-in-law exchanged bows, and once they were finished they took their seats. Soon some beautiful maidservants came to serve them with wine and steam-covered meat dishes, presented in jade bowls and golden cups, till the entire table was glowing.\n\nOnce the wine had made several rounds, the old man sent one of the maids to usher in the bride. The girl then went into an inner room, but a long time passed while no one came out. The old man himself got up, drew back a curtain, and made a plea. Presently a number of maidservants and older women came out accompanying the bride, whose ornaments and jewelry tinkled, and whose perfumes gave off the fragrances of musk and orchid.\n\nThe old man directed his daughter to face her elders and pay her respects to them, then he had her go over and sit beside her mother. Even a quick glance at her wearing her brilliant jade phoenix headdress revealed her to be a paragon of beauty.\n\nNot long afterwards, wine was poured into golden cups large enough to hold what seemed like several _dou_. Yin figured that something like this would provide effective proof to his fellows, so he secretly slipped one up inside his sleeve. Pretending to be drunk, he slumped over on the table, relaxed, and seemed to fall asleep.\n\nEveryone said, “Look, Master Yin’s drunk.” Soon the bridegroom wanted to take his leave, so the music suddenly struck up again, and one after another they all went downstairs and left.\n\nOnce they were gone and the servants began collecting the wine cups, they found they were short one and carefully hunted for it without success. One privately suggested that perhaps the sleeping guest had taken it; the old man, however, anxiously warned them not to say so, for fear that Yin might hear.\n\nAfter some time, all was quiet inside and out, so Yin stood up. It was dark since there weren’t any lamps lit, but the smell of cosmetics, perfumes, and wine still filled every portion of the room. He looked to see that in the east it was just getting light, then calmly took off, checking in his sleeve to be sure the gold cup was still there.\n\nWhen he reached the entrance, his friends were already present. The students had arrived early to wait, suspicious that he might have left the house at night in order to reenter it in the morning. Yin took out the golden cup to show them. The group, astonished, interrogated him, so he gave them an account of what had happened. They all agreed that this cup was something no impoverished scholar could afford, so they believed him.\n\nAfter all this, once Yin had passed the examination to earn the title of _jinshi_, he was appointed as magistrate for Feiqiu. There the head of an aristocratic family named Zhu threw a banquet for the new official, ordering his servants to bring out their largest wine cups—but quite some time passed and the servants didn’t return.\n\nFinally one of the lowly servants came in and whispered a report to the host, whose looks revealed him to be quite angry. After a while, a golden wine cup was offered to the guest and he was encouraged to drink up. Yin carefully examined the cup and found its patterns of refined engraving to be no different than the one he had taken from the fox. Quite curious, he inquired where the cups were made.\n\nThe host replied, “There were only eight in all after one of my ancestors, who was a minister in the capital at the time, hired a skilled artisan to supervise their crafting. Thus they’ve been heirlooms for generations, stored away like treasure for a long, long time. In honor of your presence, I wished them brought out, and just as they were to be taken from their chest, it was discovered that there were only seven. I would suspect that one of the servants had stolen it—except that ten years’ worth of undisturbed dust on the seals suggests otherwise.”\n\nYin laughed and said, “The gold cup must have sprouted wings and flown away. Certainly in this age one must guard hereditary treasures so they don’t become lost. As it happens, I have a cup quite similar to yours, that I should like to give you as a present.”\n\nOnce the banquet was ended and Yin returned to his official residence, he picked up his own cup and speedily had it delivered. His host scrutinized it and was extremely shocked.\n\nPersonally paying Yin a visit in gratitude, Zhu asked him how the cup had come into his possession. Yin then told him the details from beginning to end. Thus one learns that though a thousand _li_ away, a fox has the power to take possession of something but may not dare to keep it permanently.",

        "body": "Kong Xueli, a descendant of Confucius, was a refined and cultivated man, accomplished in poetry. A close friend of his who was a magistrate in Tiantai sent him an invitation to visit—but while Kong was traveling to stay with him, the magistrate happened to die. This left Kong without the financial means to return, so he went to live at the Putuo Monastery, where he was employed as a scribe for the monks.\n\nTo the west of the monastery, just over a hundred paces away, there was a residence belonging to a Master Shan. Although originally the son of a rich family, Master Shan had found himself in financial straits because of an extensive litigation, so he took the few members of his remaining household and moved to the country, leaving the house near Putuo untenanted.\n\nOne day, a heavy snow fell and no one was out traveling. Coincidentally, Kong was passing the house’s gate as a young man came out, attractive and quite elegant. Noticing Kong, he hurried over and greeted him politely, and after briefly making courteous acquaintance with him, humbly requested the privilege of receiving him as a visitor. Kong immediately liked his pleasant manner and happily followed him inside.\n\nThe rooms were lovely though not very large, with brocade curtains hanging everywhere, while many of the ancient masters’ calligraphy and paintings were displayed on the walls. On the table lay a volume with the title, _Trivial Records from Langxuan_. As he glanced through its pages, he found the volume filled with things he’d never read before.\n\nBecause the young man was living in the Shan residence, Kong believed him to be its owner and hence didn’t inquire into his family background. The young man skillfully examined Kong in depth about his own background, feeling a genuine sympathy for him and advising him to set himself up as a teacher.\n\nKong sighed and said, “A wanderer like me? Who’d even agree to recommend me?”\n\nThe young man replied, “If you won’t reject a worthless person like myself, I hope you’ll allow me to be your student.” Kong was very pleased by this, but didn’t dare presume to act as the young man’s instructor, requesting instead that they be friends.\n\nThen he asked the young man, “Why has your house been closed up for so long?”\n\n“This mansion belongs to Master Shan,” he responded, “who used to live here before he moved to the country and hence it has been empty a long time. My family name is Huangfu and our home used to be in Shaanxi. Because our family home was burned down in a wildfire, we’ve arranged to take refuge here temporarily.” It wasn’t until this point that Kong realized the young man was not Master Shan. That same night, they laughed and chatted very merrily till finally Kong was invited to stay and share the young man’s bed.\n\nAt dawn, a servant boy came in to light a charcoal fire in the room. The young man had risen earlier and gone into an inner room while Kong remained there, sitting with the bedspread hugged around him. The boy then entered again and announced, “The master has arrived.” Surprised, Kong stood up.\n\nAn older man, the hair on his temples showing white, came in, turned towards Kong and eagerly thanked him, saying, “Sir, you’ve been kind enough not to abandon my dullard son, and have even agreed to offer him instruction. The youngster is just beginning to work on his poor composition skills, so don’t treat him as a friend, but instead as your student.” With these words he presented Kong with a brocade suit, a sable hat, stockings, and a pair of shoes.\n\nHe watched while Kong finished washing his face and combing his hair, then called for wine and food to be set out. Kong didn’t know what the table, bed, and clothing were made of that gave them their eye-dazzling luster. The wine went around a number of times, then the old man sat up and took his leave, departing with the aid of his walking stick.\n\nWhen the meal had ended, the young master submitted the lessons he’d prepared in the characters and phrasings of antiquity, not one of them written in the contemporary style. When Kong asked him about this, he answered, laughing, “I’m not trying to win any official recognition.” With the sun beginning to set, he poured out more wine, saying, “This evening we’ll make merry till we’re exhausted—because tomorrow it’ll no longer be permitted.” He called out to the servant boy, “See if the master’s asleep or not; if he’s sleeping, sneak over and call for Xiangnu.” The boy went out, and then came back in with an embroidered bag that held a pipa.\n\nIn no time at all, a maidservant entered, stunning in her gorgeous make-up. The young master had her play “The Two Wives of Emperor Shun.” Xiangnu used an ivory pick to strum the strings, arousing resonant feelings of desolation, with a rhythm unlike anything Kong had ever heard before. The young master then told her to take some huge cups and fill them with wine, and they didn’t stop until the third watch.\n\nThe next day, the young master and Kong rose early to study together. The young master was exceptionally bright, being able to recite accurately what he had looked over only once, and in just two or three months, could construct an excellent composition expressing wise opinions. They agreed to drink together every five days, making certain that Xiangnu was always summoned.\n\nOne evening, when his joyful drinking had begun to make him feel horny, Kong started staring at Xiangnu. The young master was able to guess his intentions and said, “This maid was raised by my aging father. Elder brother, since you’ve been alone for a long time and have no wife, I’ve been planning day and night for a long time to find someone for you. I’ll be sure she’s a beautiful mate.”\n\nKong replied, “If you really mean it, that’d be a great favor—as long as she’s just like Xiangnu.”\n\nThe young master laughed as he observed, “You’re proof indeed that ‘what the experienced see as commonplace, the inexperienced find extraordinary.’ If she’s your idea of a beauty, your wish will be easy to satisfy.”\n\nAfter he’d been there half a year, Kong decided one day to explore the countryside, but when he arrived at the gate, he found it bolted shut from the outside and went to inquire about it. The young master explained to him, “My father worries that if I get involved with too many people I’ll be distracted from my studies, so that’s why he’s discouraging visitors.” That made sense to Kong.\n\nAt that time, the sweltering summer weather was heating up, so they moved their study to a garden pavilion. Kong noticed a swelling on his chest that grew to the size of a peach and overnight became as big as a bowl, the pain of which made him groan aloud. The young master watched over him constantly, going without sleep and food.\n\nAfter several days, the affliction became so severe that Kong could no longer eat or drink. The old master also came to look in, so the father and son lamented together. The young master said, “Last night, thinking about Master Kong’s ailment, I realized that younger sister Jiaona might have the skills to heal him. I sent someone to grandmother’s to ask her to come—what could be taking her so long?”\n\nSuddenly the servant entered and reported, “Miss Na is here; Auntie and Miss Song have also come.” Father and son quickly hastened them inside. Shortly after, the young man led his sister out to take a look at Kong. She was about thirteen or fourteen years old, her lovely eyes sparkling with intellect and her willowy figure making her even more attractive. When Kong stared into her face, he forgot to groan and no longer looked distressed, his spirit improving remarkably.\n\nThe young master then explained, “This gentleman is my dear friend, as close to me as if we were brothers. Sister, do your best to cure him.” The girl then set aside her shyness, and with her long sleeves trailing behind her, approached the bed to examine him. As she reached out to take his pulse, he perceived a fragrant aroma surpassing that of orchids.\n\nWith a smile, she said, “It’s no surprise you have this condition, since your heart rate has accelerated. Although the illness is life-threatening, it can be cured; however, this lump of tissue is already dead, so we simply must trim away the skin and cut off the flesh.” Then she took a gold bracelet from her arm and calmly placed it over the troubled area, steadily pressing down on it. The swelling puffed up about an inch, poking up through the bracelet, until the base of the swelling was contained entirely inside it, so it was no longer the size of a bowl in diameter.\n\nWith one hand, she opened the front of her thin gown and unfastened the knife she was wearing that had an edge as thin as paper, then while holding the bracelet in place, she took the blade, gently set it at the base of the lump, and began cutting it. A flood of purple blood began to flow, soaking into and staining the bed mat, but Kong was so eager for the beauty to be near him that he not only didn’t feel the pains—he was even afraid that she might finish the surgery too quickly, preventing him from being close to her for a longer period of time.\n\nNot long after, a piece of the rotten flesh that had been cut broke off, rolling away like a gall that had been trimmed from a tree. Jiaona then called for some water to cleanse the site of the cut. From her mouth she spat out a sizeable red pellet, then touched it to the wounded flesh, pressed it down and rolled it around and around: after the first revolution, it began to feel hot enough to turn water to steam; after the second revolution, this turned to a gentle itching; after she finished the third revolution, his body began to relax and cool off all over, penetrating to his very bones and marrow.\n\nThe girl then returned the pellet to her throat, announced, “You’re cured!” and hastily walked away. Kong jumped up and ran to thank her; it was as if his illness had vanished. But whenever he thought about her shining beauty, he couldn’t stop his pangs of longing. From then on, he ignored his books and sat around in a daze, as though he had nothing to live for.\n\nThe young master, who’d already observed this behavior, encouraged him, “Elder brother, I’ve scouted out a beautiful mate for you.”\n\n“Who?” Kong asked.\n\nHe replied, “She’s also a member of my family.”\n\nKong thought hard about this for a good long time, and then replied, “No need.” With his face to the wall, he recited, “To one who’s already passed through the great seas, other waters are nothing difficult; / Except for those surrounding Wushan, there are no other clouds.”\n\nThe young master recognized his meaning and responded, “My father admires and respects your significant talents, and has often wished for you to marry into the family. But I only have one little sister and she’s just too young. There’s my cousin, Song, who’s eighteen and far from coarse or crude. If you won’t believe unless you can see for yourself, Song’s daily routine takes her to a pavilion in the garden—you can be waiting there in a side-room to take a look at her.”\n\nKong did as he was instructed and as a result saw Jiaona arrive in the company of a real beauty, her painted black eyebrows curved like moth antennae, her tiny feet adorned in phoenix slippers, in appearance Jiaona’s equal. Kong was greatly pleased, and invited the young master to serve as his go-between in the marriage plans.\n\nThe next day, the young master came outside and congratulated him: “It’s a match.” Then he cleared another courtyard for Kong’s wedding ceremony. At sunset, court music filled the air, shaking the dust loose everywhere, and as he looked at the fairy maid snuggled beside him under a large quilt and canopy, he began to wonder whether the goddess’ palace wasn’t necessarily located in the heavens. They were very happy indeed.\n\nOne day the young master informed Kong, “I have learned much from your benevolent instruction, and I’ll never forget about it. Recently Master Shan resolved his litigation and is returning, anxious to move back into his home, so we intend to leave this place for Shaanxi. Under the circumstances, it will be difficult for us to meet again, and the sadness of being apart from you is very much on my mind.”\n\nKong expressed his desire to leave with them. The young master advised him to return to his hometown, which put Kong in a rather awkward position since he lacked the money to pay for the trip. “Don’t worry,” the young master comforted him, “I’ll ensure that you get there right away.”\n\nSoon, the old gentleman led Song out, and presented Kong with a hundred gold taels. Then the young master grasped Kong by his right hand and his wife by her left, instructing them to shut their eyes and to keep them shut. They began to float as though walking on air, sensing only the sound of the wind in their ears, until after a long time their comrade said, “We’re here.” They opened their eyes and could see they were in Kong’s old neighborhood. At that moment he realized that the young master was something other than human.\n\nJoyfully, Kong knocked at his family’s door. His mother, thrilled, came out to meet his beautiful wife, and they rejoiced that they were together again. When they turned around to look for him, the young master had vanished. Song proved to be a filial daughter to her mother-in-law; word of her glamour and her virtue spread far and wide.\n\nAfterwards, Kong became a _jinshi_ and was appointed to a judge’s position in Yan’an district, so he brought his family along to his post. His mother stayed behind since it was such a long distance for her to travel. Song became mother to a son, who was named Xiaohuan.\n\nKong then opposed a superior and was dismissed from his appointment, finding himself forced to stay there without being able to return home. Coincidentally, while out hunting in the countryside, he came across a handsome young man, riding a black horse, who kept turning around again and again to look at him. Scrutinizing him carefully, he realized it was young master Huangfu. He grabbed the reins to stop his horse, experiencing mixed feelings of grief and joy.\n\nThe young master invited Kong to go home with him and they arrived at a village where the trees were planted so densely that they made it dark, their luxuriant growth blocking out the sky and sun. Entering the young master’s house, he noticed the door’s decorative gold nails, the sure sign of a powerful family with generations of influence.\n\nHe inquired about Jiaona and learned that she had married; his mother-in-law had died, and the men commiserated together, moved by her loss. He stayed overnight and then departed, returning together later with his wife. Jiaona also arrived, hugged Kong’s son, picked him up and carried him around, teasing Song, “Elder sister, you’ve mixed up our species.” Kong again paid his respects to Jiaona, thanking her for her former cure of him.\n\nSmiling, she replied, “Brother-in-law, you’re an important person now. Your wound is long healed, but you haven’t forgotten its pain?” Jiaona’s husband, Master Wu, also arrived to visit them. They stayed two nights and then departed.\n\nOne day, the young master, with a worried look, told Kong, “Heaven is about to drop catastrophe on us—can you help to save us?” Kong didn’t know what this was all about, but he spiritedly volunteered his assistance. The young master quickly stepped out, beckoning his family to come into the hall, kneel down around him, and show submission to Scholar Kong. Astonished by this, Kong anxiously asked for an explanation.\n\nThe young master answered, “We’re not human beings, but foxes. We’re about to be destroyed by thunder and lighting. Sir, if you agree to risk your life to face this disaster, there may still be hope for our survival. If not, please take your son in your arms and go, and you won’t be involved.”\n\nKong swore that he would live or die with them. Thus they directed him to stand at the door with a sword, warning him, “When thunder and lightning crack and strike at you, you must not move!” Kong took his place as instructed. Sure enough, as he watched, dark clouds blocked out the light of day, the sinister darkness as black as basalt.\n\nWhen he turned around to look at where they’d been living, the gate was no longer there—in its place he saw a towering grave mound and a cavernous, bottomless pit. Just as he was standing there startled, there came the sound of a thunderclap that shook the lofty mountains like a fan; the pelting rain and violent winds uprooted even long-established trees. Kong was dazzled and deafened, but stood like a mountain, unmoved.\n\nSuddenly from within an expanding column of thick, black smoke, he saw an evil spirit, with sharp beak and long talons, emerge from the pit with a person it had seized, following the smoke straight upwards. He caught a glimpse of the person’s clothes and shoes, recognizing them as Jiaona’s. Anxiously he leapt up and attacked the thing with his sword, fortunately bringing Jiaona back down.\n\nAll of a sudden a violent burst of thunder exploded, and Kong fell to the ground, dead. In a short time, the sky cleared up and Jiaona began to revive. When she found Kong dead at her side, she cried piteously, lamenting, “Master Kong has died for me, so how can I still live!” Song also emerged from the pit, and together the women carried Kong back.\n\nJiaona had Song hold her husband’s head up while the young master used a golden hairpin to pry open his teeth; she then pinched his cheeks, used her tongue to push her red pellet into his mouth, then joined her lips to his and blew. The red pellet was forced into his throat by the breath and his throat made a gurgling sound. In a little while, he returned to life. He saw his whole family in front of him, as if he’d just awakened from a dream. The family all gathered around in a circle, their initial fright dissipated and now filled with happiness.\n\nBecause of the pit’s connection to the underworld, Kong decided they couldn’t live in their residence any longer, and proposed that they all return to his village. Everyone offered their support except for Jiaona, who seemed unhappy. Kong requested that she and her husband, Master Wu, join the rest of them, but upon thinking it over, she worried that her husband’s parents would miss their grandchildren, so they discussed the matter all day long without settling it.\n\nSuddenly a Wu family servant arrived, sweating profusely and gasping for air. Alarmed, they immediately began to ask him questions and it came out that Master Wu’s household that same day had also met with disaster, and that the entire family had been wiped out. Jianona was completely heartbroken, unable to stop crying. Together, they consoled and encouraged her.\n\nAnd thus the return to Kong’s hometown was planned and approved. Kong went into the city for a number of days to take care of matters, then he joined the others as they hastened to load everything for a journey by night. Upon their arrival, an isolated garden, which remained bolted from the outside, became the young master’s residence; only when Kong and Song appeared was the bolt removed. Kong passed the time with the young master and Jiaona, playing chess, drinking wine, chatting and dining, as if they were all members of one family. Xiaohuan grew up to be quite accomplished, with very handsome features and a trace of the fox in him. When he went out for a walk in the city, everyone could tell he was the son of a fox.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Regarding Scholar Kong, I envy him not because he married a gorgeous wife, but because he found a true friend. Looking into the face of such a friend can make one forget hunger; listening to such a friend speak can make one smile. To gain such a good friend, with time to chat and to eat together, is much more pleasing to the spirit than ‘clothing attractively disarrayed.’”",

The king examined his book of death records and became furious with the ghost envoy for accidentally having brought him the wrong person, reproachfully ordering that he be taken back.\n\nAs Zhang walked out of the king’s presence, he secretly asked a favor of the envoy, begging for a look at Hell’s prisons. The ghost guided him through the various levels of the underworld, past the Mountain of Swords and the Grove of Daggers, pointing out each spot one by one. At last they arrived at a place where there was a Buddhist monk, hanging by a rope that had been inserted into a hole bored through his thigh, howling in pain and begging to be cut down.\n\nApproaching to take a closer look, Zhang could see it was his elder brother. The sight left Zhang terrified and distressed as he asked, “What crime has deserved this?”\n\nThe ghost replied, “He was a monk who traveled widely to solicit large monetary donations which he spent on whoring and gambling—and that’s the reason for his punishment. If he wishes to be free of this torment, he must repent for what he has done.”\n\nOnce Zhang had been restored to life, he figured that his elder brother must have died already. He left for his brother’s residence at Xingfu Monastery to find out what had happened. Upon entering the doorway, he could hear the sound of his brother howling in pain. Coming into his room, he could see a sore spot on his thigh which was oozing pus and blood—his leg, elevated, was hanging from the wall, reminiscent of its suspension in that place in the underworld.\n\nAstonished, Zhang asked him what was going on. He explained, “Suspending it helps; otherwise, the pain’s overwhelming.” Zhang informed his brother about what he’d seen in the underworld. The monk was so profoundly startled, he consequently gave up meat and alcohol and began piously chanting sutras. In half a month he began healing. Thereupon he became a completely sincere monk.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The ghosts’ prison appears insubstantial and far off, so all sinful persons use this to excuse their guilty acts; but they don’t realize that the punishment in the underworld comes as a result of wicked behavior in the mortal world.

        "body": "Master Yu was generous and chivalrous as a young man, fond of boxing, and fearless, possessing sufficient strength to hold a colossal kettle and dance with it, spinning like a whirlwind. During Chongzhen’s reign, while Yu was taking the imperial examination in the capital, his servant fell ill and couldn’t even raise himself, which troubled Yu a great deal.\n\nA certain skilled fortune-teller, able to forecast a person’s life and death, happened to be working in the marketplace, so Yu went to make inquiries on behalf of his servant. When he arrived, he didn’t say a word, so the fortune-teller said, “Doesn’t the gentleman wish to ask about his servant’s illness?”\n\nStartled, Master Yu acknowledged that he did. The fortune-teller replied, “The servant’s illness will not harm him—it is his master who’s in danger.” Master Yu then had his own future divined. The fortune-teller consulted the Eight Diagrams and said in a shaken voice, “The gentleman will be dead in three days!” Master Yu stood stunned for quite some time. The fortune-teller then added with unhurried calm, “I possess a bit of magic and if you’ll requite me with ten taels of silver, I’ll avert the evils for you.”\n\nMaster Yu considered to himself that since the times of one’s birth and death are fated, magic was unlikely to be able to change that; hence he declined and stood up, intending to leave. The fortune-teller declared, “Spare this little fee, or you’ll be sorry. You’ll be sorry!” All those who cared about Master Yu were worried about him after they heard this news and advised him to empty his money bag so the fortune-teller would save his life. But Master Yu wouldn’t hear of it.\n\nVery quickly the three days elapsed while Master Yu sat at his inn, calmly waiting to see if the time for his death had come. The whole day, he was quite safe. When night fell, he shut his door, turned up his lamp, and leaned upon his sword to await the pending peril. When the first watch had already passed, there was still no sign of his death. He was just thinking about going to bed when he heard a rustling sound at a crack in his window.\n\nHe anxiously watched as a tiny man entered, carrying a halberd over his shoulder; upon touching the ground, he instantly grew as tall as a normal person. Master Yu grabbed and raised his sword, striking swiftly, but it fluttered away and so he missed it. Then it hastily shrank again, turned and made for the window, intending to escape through the crack. Master Yu quickly chopped at it, cutting it down. He brought over the lamp, which revealed it to be a paper man that had been cut in two at the waist. Master Yu didn’t dare lie down, so instead he just sat and waited.\n\nAfter a bit, something pushed through the window and entered, some horrible kind of monster. Just as soon as it touched the ground, he leapt to attack it, cutting it in two, though each half continued to squirm about. Fearing that it might rise again and reconnect itself, he made every sword thrust count, yet it didn’t sound like he was hitting something fleshy. On careful inspection, he found it to be a figure made of earth, now broken into many fragments.\n\nMaster Yu moved to sit next to the window, his eyes concentrating on the crack there. Quite a bit of time elapsed, then outside the window he heard something like an ox breathing heavily and something began pushing against the window lattice, making the entire wall of the room shake so powerfully that it threatened to collapse. Master Yu feared he might be crushed, and calculated that he’d have a better chance by fighting outside, so he slammed open the bolt on his door and rushed out.\n\nThere he saw a giant of a demon, as tall as the eaves of the house; in the dim moonlight he could tell that its face was black as coal, its eyes flashing with a bright yellow light; it wore neither clothing nor shoes, but held a bow, while carrying arrows at its waist. As Master Yu stood there astonished, the demon drew its bow and shot at him. Master Yu deflected the arrow with his sword and it fell to the ground; just as he was about to strike back, it shot another arrow. Master Yu deftly dove out of its way, the arrow hitting a wall with a reverberating sound.\n\nThe demon, infuriated, pulled out a knife it wore at its waist, whirled it like the wind, and with its force aimed a blow that was meant to gut Master Yu. Yu jumped out of the way like a monkey and the blade came down on a stone in the yard, splitting it. Master Yu then scrambled between the demon’s legs and slashed at its ankle, which made a metallic clanging noise. The demon became even angrier, roaring like thunder and twisting its body around to attack again. Master Yu crouched and again ducked through its legs; the knife came down and sheared off some of his gown. Master Yu came up under its armpit, delivering a violent thrust that also made a clanging sound, and the demon fell to the ground, motionless. Master Yu struck wildly at it, the sound echoing like a watchman’s woodblock.\n\nBy the light of a lamp, he found it to be a wooden idol, the size of a man. The bow and arrows were still tied at its waist and its features had been carved and painted to appear hideous; blood seeped out from those places where his sword had struck. Consequently, Master Yu kept the light in hand and waited for daybreak, now aware that the monsters had all been sent by the fortuneteller who wanted Yu dead to prove his magic was real.\n\nThe next day, he told everyone he knew to join him in paying a visit to the fortune-teller’s place of business. From a distance the fortune-teller saw Master Yu, who was looking his way—but saw nothing there. “That’s his magic to fool the eye,” somebody said, “but dog’s blood ruins it.”\n\nMaster Yu followed this advice, working covertly to prepare it, and then he came back. The fortune-teller disappeared like before. Yu quickly poured the dog’s blood on the place where he’d been standing, revealing the fortune-teller’s head and face, dripping with blood, his eyes burning there like a ghost’s. Then he was handed over to the authorities and executed.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “As I have said before, paying for fortunes is a silly thing to do. In all the world, how many people are there who can accurately identify when someone will be born or die? The purchased fortune turns out either to be inaccurate or not really to be a fortune at all. In addition, even if someone unerringly tells me when I can expect to die, isn’t there anything I can do to change my future? What a horrible situation it is for someone to abuse fate and his own supernatural magic just for the sake of proving his fortune-telling ability!”",

Li used all his might to stay hidden so it couldn’t get to him, but the creature shoved away the corpse covering him till it could see Li’s head.\n\nHis fear increasing, with one hand Li searched underneath his waist, until he found a stone as huge as a bowl and grabbed it.

        "body": "A _juren_ named Liu had the ability to recall details from previous incarnations. He was always narrating them for my elder brother, Wenbi, who’d become a _juren_ the same year he had.\n\nIn a previous life, Liu had been an official who was responsible for many transgressions. When he reached the age of 62, he died. He went immediately to see the Hell King, who received him courteously as a scholar and an official, inviting him to sit and sip some tea. Stealing a glance at the inside of the Hell King’s cup, Liu noticed that his tea appeared entirely clear, while in his own small cup it was muddy, like wine with the dregs still in it. Puzzled and deeply suspicious, he wondered: was it really some infernal brew? Taking advantage when the Hell King looked away, he poured his cup down the corner of their table, making a show of having finished it all.\n\nShortly afterward, the Hell King turned to an account of the evils associated with Liu’s life; furious at what he found, he ordered a group of demons to hold him down and punish him by sending him back as a horse. Grim demons bound him and took him away at once.\n\nThey traveled and arrived at a particular home, the entrance to which was up so high that Liu was unable to go any further. Just as he faltered there, the demons vigorously flogged him, causing him so much pain that he unconsciously raised his leg.\n\nWhen he looked around, he found himself on the ground in a stable. Then he heard someone say, “The black horse’s given birth to a pony, a colt.” In his heart he understood this all too well, but was unable to speak. He felt starved, but couldn’t find anything to stop his hunger, so he followed a mare around, begging for milk.\n\nAfter four or five years, Liu grew quite powerful. Nevertheless, he was terrified of the pain of the whip, and upon even seeing it would flee in dread. When his master rode him, he always added some padding to ease the load and would gradually slacken the reins as they went, so it wasn’t all unpleasant; but when it was the servants or groom, they’d go without outfitting him with any extra saddle cloth, digging their heels into his sides until the pain penetrated to his very bowels. Eventually, in a fit of anger, he went without eating for three days and succeeded in dying.\n\nLiu arrived again in the underworld, where the Hell King determined that he had not fulfilled the terms of his punishment, reproaching him for plotting to get out of it—so he had Liu’s skin peeled off and sentenced him to become a dog. Liu felt depressed and didn’t want to go. A group of demons flogged him wildly till his pain was so extreme that he fled out into the wilds. Thinking to himself that it would be better to try to end it all, he flung himself off a cliff, and after the jolt of impact he was unable to stand up.\n\nLooking around, he found himself curled up inside a burrow, with a female dog licking and protecting him, and then he realized his body had been reborn into the world. As time passed, he came to recognize that urine and feces were dirty—even though they smelled good to him—and hence he refused to lap them up.\n\nAfter he’d been a dog for a year, Liu found himself constantly angry and wishing to die again, though also afraid he’d be found guilty of trying to evade his punishment. In addition, his owner was feeding and supporting him, and would never agree to kill him. For that reason he decided to bite his owner, tearing some flesh from his thigh. The owner, furious, beat him to death with his cane.\n\nThe Hell King, checking over his case again, furious at his bestial stubbornness, had him whipped several hundred times and then sent him back as a snake. Liu found himself a prisoner in an isolated room where it was so dark he couldn’t even see daylight. He became so bored that he found a wall and went up it, spotted a hole in the wall and got out through it. When he looked around himself, seeing his body lying in the lush grass, it became clear he really was living as a snake. Thereupon he made the determined vow not to harm any living thing and to eat only vegetarian foods.\n\nAs the years went by, he was always brooding over the fact that he couldn’t commit suicide, nor could he harm other people so they’d kill him; he longed for an acceptable strategy for dying, but was unable to come up with one. One day, while laying in the grass, he heard a cart approaching and hastily crawled over to the road; the cart sped right over him, slicing him in two.\n\nThe Hell King was surprised by his speedy return, so Liu prostrated himself and revealed what had happened. The Hell King ruled that he could see no crimes associated with his death, so he pardoned him, declaring that he had fulfilled the terms of his punishment and could return as a man—which is how he became Master Liu.\n\nMaster Liu was born with the ability to speak, and could recite compositions, letters and books after having read them only once. In the first year of the reign of Tianqi, he qualified as a _juren_. His advice to others was always the same: when riding a horse, be sure to give him a nice thick saddle blanket; and digging one’s heels into the sides of a horse inflicts a punishment more painful even than flogging.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Among the animals there are former noblemen; at the same time, some noblemen were once animals. When a humble person does a good deed, it’s like planting a tree in order for it to flower later; when a great person does a good deed, it’s like nurturing the roots of the tree that has already been brought to flower: such a person should grow a bigger tree and nurture longer roots. Otherwise, one is merely pulling a salt cart, enduring the bridle as a horse does; or else one is just lapping up urine and feces like a dog until it’s killed and cooked; or if not, one is just throwing on a scaly armor in order to end up buried in the belly of a crane or stork, like a snake.”",

The wife then quickly stuffed a stopper in its mouth, popped it into a cauldron, and heated the water in it until it was boiling. The jug’s temperature soared and the fox cried out, “It’s too hot! Don’t be so mean.” The wife, meanwhile, said nothing.\n\nIts howls became increasingly urgent, but after a long while there was finally no more sound. She pulled out the stopper and looked inside, finding a pile of fur and several spots of blood."

        "body": "At the time of the Xie Qian rebellion, many officials’ houses were taken over by the rebellious mob. Wang Xueshi’s house in Qixiang was especially plundered by the assembled crowd. The city was pacified once national soldiers occupied the city and proceeded to slaughter the renegades, whose corpses were piled along the city steps, and whose blood filled the streets and flowed through every gate.\n\nMaster Wang reentered the city as the corpses were being carried out and the blood washed away, and took up residence once again. His family began seeing spirits all the time, even during the day; at night, ghostly lights flew under their beds and sat in the corners of their rooms, weeping.\n\nOne day, Wang’s underling, Hao Di, stayed overnight with Master Wang’s family, and from the end of his bed he heard a small voice crying, “Hao Di! Hao Di!” It ceased and then gradually became louder, moaning, “I died wrongfully!” The weeping and wailing filled the entire courtyard.\n\nMaster Wang heard this, took up his sword and entered, boasting loudly, “Don’t you know that I’m Wang Xueshi, the public official?” Despite this, he heard a hundred voices sneering and jeering, mocking him.\n\nMaster Wang consequently established an altar for performing religious rituals to help the ghosts make their departure peacefully. When he left out some cooked rice for the ghosts that night, he saw many glowing lights flit around here and there, so he followed them. He was led to a gatekeeper, also named Wang, who had become seriously ill, remaining confused and unable to recognize people for a number of days.\n\nThat night, he suddenly yawned and stretched as if just waking up. His wife then got him to eat. The gatekeeper explained to her, “While I don’t know why, the master left some cooked rice out in the courtyard, and I joined a crowd of others who were gobbling it up. Basically, then, when I was finished eating, I returned here, and now I don’t feel hungry at all.” Henceforth, the ghosts stopped appearing there any more. Wasn’t this likely the positive result of inviting Buddhists to perform their religious rituals there?\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Demons and ghosts exist, but only virtue can stop them. At the time the city was taken over by the mobs, Master Wang’s influence was so strong and powerful that people would tremble just at the mention of his name; but the ghosts didn’t fear him at all. Maybe that’s because the ghosts didn’t realize that Master Wang wouldn’t let them stay there. This demonstrates the limited power of public officials: when human faces are unable to scare away ghosts, let’s hope the ghosts don’t use theirs to frighten away people!”",

The family members had to hurry and run for cover, then wait for the fox to stop before venturing out to go on with their activities. Master Dong was so upset over this that he borrowed the house of Sun Sima, another official, and moved into it to escape the fox. Meanwhile the spirit continued to make trouble.\n\nOne day, while waiting for an imperial meeting to begin, Dong began chatting with the other officers about the strange events. A great courtier told him that there was a Daoist priest named Jiaoming, from Guangdong, who now lived in the capital. He possessed the magical skill to control evil spirits.\n\nMaster Dong traveled to the Daoist’s cottage and requested his assistance. Jiaoming created a red amulet for him and sent him back home to paste it up on one of his walls. The fox, however, didn’t fear the amulet and subsequently began to throw down even more things.\n\nMaster Dong went back again to inform the Daoist. Jiaoming was furious, so he personally paid a visit to Dong’s household, piling up earthenware jars and exercising his magic on them. Instantly they were able to see an enormous fox lying prostrate next to the jar. The family members had endured its ceaseless cruelties for a long time, harboring an extremely deep grudge, so one of the maid servants drew close to strike it.\n\nThe maid servant suddenly fell to the ground, unable to breathe.\n\nJiaoming declared, “This thing is on a rampage—even I haven’t been able to frighten it, and the woman shouldn’t have attacked it recklessly.” Then he added, “We might use her body to hear what the fox has to confess.”\n\nMaking a hand gesture over his halberd, he directed an incantation to the fox through the maid, and the maidservant suddenly rose till she was kneeling upright. The Daoist then grilled the fox about where he lived. The maid servant, speaking as the fox, declared, “I was born in the western regions, then entered the capital where I have already lived for eighteen lifetimes.”\n\nThe Daoist exclaimed, “How dare you live in the imperial capital for so long? We need you to leave now!” The fox made no reply. Jiaoming struck a table in anger, demanding, “Are you trying to resist my command? If so, you’d better think twice—my magic won’t forgive you!”\n\nTerrified, the fox then crouched and changed his facial expression, honestly and sincerely expressing his respect for the priest’s warnings. Jiaoming again told him to go away quickly. The maid servant fell forward again, breathless, and after a long time began to regain consciousness.\n\nImmediately, they saw a group of four or five round white lumps, rolling like balls, come near the edge of the roof’s eaves before moving away, one following after another, and in an instant they were all gone. As a result, the place was peaceful thereafter."

        "title": "Scholar Ye",
        "body": "In Huaiyang, there was a scholar named Ye—I’ve lost track of his first name. He was gifted in the writing of compositions and poetry, which were always first-rate by the time he’d finish them; but he didn’t have good fortune and always failed in the official examinations.\n\nThen he became associated with Ding Chenghe, who’d arrived from Guandong to take charge of their political district, and who’d looked at Ye’s writing and been quite impressed by it; Ye was invited to speak with him, and the resulting exchange absolutely delighted Ding. He immediately provided Ye with an office in the government building and lights to study by; at times, he even gave him money and food to provide for his family.\n\nOn the occasion of the preliminary examination that preceded the triennial imperial examinations, Magistrate Ding roundly praised Ye’s learning to the imperial examiner and consequently he was considered the best of a group of examinees. The magistrate expected he would surely produce an excellent examination.\n\nAfter Ye had taken the county examination, Ding asked to see what he’d written and read it aloud, beating out the cadences and praising them. But expectations are often frustrated, and his compositions were fated to be rejected, so when the list of successful candidates was released, as usual he had failed again.\n\nYe was demoralized and returned home, ashamed that his dear friend had trusted him to succeed, so his appearance began to deteriorate until he was reduced almost to bones and looked as senseless as a wooden figure. Magistrate Ding received news of this, summoned him, and upon his arrival attempted to console him. Ye’s tears fell like rain that would not cease. Ding, pitying him, suggested that when the time came for him to go to the capital to give a full account of his own work, he could bring Ye along to take part in everything there.\n\nYe was very moved and grateful. Taking his leave and returning home, he closed his doors and refused to venture out. In no time he was confined to bed by illness. Magistrate Ding continually sent inquiries and help; Ye took over a hundred doses of Chinese traditional medicines, but they had no effect at all.\n\nBy chance, for being defiant to an official above him, Magistrate Ding was to be removed from office and was about to vacate his official position. He sent a letter to Ye, which, in brief, said, “The day for my return to the east has come; I’ve been slow to do so because I’ve been waiting for you to join me. If you will arrive this morning, you and I can leave this evening together.” It was delivered to Ye while he lay in bed. He held the letter, sobbing piteously.\n\nYe entrusted these words to Ding’s envoy: “My illness has become too severe for me to recover so hastily; please go on ahead.” When the envoy returned and delivered the message, Ding couldn’t bear to leave, and patiently waited for Ye to recover.\n\nWhen a number of days had passed, the man at the gate suddenly made way for Scholar Ye, who had just arrived. Elated, Ding welcomed him and inquired about his condition. Ye replied, “Since I was taken ill, I’ve troubled you into waiting for me a long time and I’ve been extremely concerned that I’ve caused you worry. Now it’s my good fortune to be able to accompany you, sir.” Ding accordingly packed his clothes to be ready to depart early at daybreak.\n\nWhen they arrived at Ding’s hometown, he ordered his son, Zaichang, to work as Ye’s student, so from morning till night Ye was always accompanied by the boy, who was sixteen years old but still unable to compose a literary essay. Yet he was peerlessly bright, and whenever he’d read over a piece of literature just two or three times, he could always recall it, without forgetting a thing.\n\nOnce Ye had been living with them for a year, Zaichang proved able to begin writing accomplished literary essays. With this improvement and his father’s influence, he was able to become a _xiucai_. Ye intended to teach the boy as much as he could, writing down everything he knew for Zaichang to review. In the examination hall, Zaichang wrote on seven topics without missing any of them, and finished second from the top.\n\nDing said to Ye one day, “You only used the leftovers of your wisdom, and they were enough to help my boy succeed in the examination. Yet your outstanding talents continue to be ignored—there must be something we can do!”\n\nYe replied, “I’m afraid it’s fated. But because you’ve lent me some of your good fortune, my writings will finally receive an audience and make everyone understand that while half of my life has been profitless, it’s not because I lacked the talent to succeed—that will be enough to wish for. What’s more, if a scholar obtains even one person who knows and appreciates him thoroughly, there should be no trace of regret at all. There’s no point in bothering to take off the white clothes of the _xiucai_ only to chase after degrading fame and profit.”\n\nSince Ye had been staying with them for such a long time, Ding, fearing he might miss the yearly examination, strongly advised him to return to his home province. Ye, saddened by this, felt miserable. Ding couldn’t bear to force Ye to leave, so he asked his son to buy an official title for Ye when Zaichang went to the capital for the examination there.\n\nZaichang was successful once again in the examination at the southern palace and was conferred the administrative head of a department there. He brought Ye along to his imperial office, where they were together from morning till night.\n\nThe following year, Ye took part in the civil service examination in the capital and surprisingly won the title of _juren_. Just at that time, Zaichang was assigned to take charge of the Southern Yellow River District’s affairs, and said to him, “This posting will take me to a place not far from your home town. Master, you’ve been promoted to an esteemed position, so your glorious return will be a happy event.” Ye was equally joyful and chose an auspicious date for them to journey on their way. When they reached the borders of Huaiyang, Zaichang ordered an attendant to take a horse and accompany Scholar Ye home.\n\nUpon his return, he saw his house and noticed how dreary it looked, which made him very sad. While he walked around to the courtyard, his wife came out carrying a dustpan, saw Ye, threw the utensil down and backed away. Ye said to her, “I’m a respected individual now. Even though it’s been three or four years since we’ve been together, how can it be that you suddenly don’t recognize me?”\n\nKeeping her distance from him, his wife replied, “You’ve been dead already for a long time, so what’s this talk about being respected? We’d have buried you in your coffin a long time ago, but the family was too poor, and our son was too young to bury you. Now our son’s finally establishing himself and is about to consult a diviner about a suitable gravesite. Don’t do anything strange at this point to scare those who’re still alive.”\n\nYe was puzzled and saddened to hear all this. Wavering at first, he entered the house, saw a dignified coffin containing a corpse, then threw himself to the ground and vanished. His wife, alarmed, inspected his remains and found only his cap, gown, and shoes, as though they’d been peeled off and abandoned there. Powerfully grieved, she held his clothes in her arms and wept.\n\nTheir son, returning from school, saw a team of horses tied up at the gate, found out where they’d come from, and ran, amazed, to inform his mother. She wiped away her tears and told him what had happened. They carefully made inquiries of Ye’s attendant, and only then did they get the whole story.\n\nThe attendant returned to give Zaichang the news, and his tears ran till they dripped down his chest. At once he gave the order that they should travel, all of them weeping, to Ye’s house; from a purse he took out money to cover the funeral costs, and they buried Ye with a ceremony befitting a _juren_. Zaichang was similarly generous in giving support to Ye’s son, and he hired a tutor to instruct him in his studies. Zaichang praised Ye’s son, and the next year he successfully passed the lowest level civil service examination to become a _xiucai_.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Is it possible that a man could follow his closest friend even after he’s already died, and not realize the fact of his death? Although someone hearing Ye’s story might doubt this, I am firmly convinced of it. At heart, it’s the same as the story of Qian Niang, whose soul left her body behind, resting on a pillow, to following her lover; though 1,000 _li_ separated the good friends, it seems that they could stay connected through the roads in their dreams.\n\n“Naturally, for scholars, their compositions and hand-written drafts are their most cherished treasures. Whether these are truly excellent or not, they constitute the heart and life of a scholar! That’s just the way it is!\n\n“It’s hard to know when you’ll meet someone who’ll appreciate you or when you’ll experience good fortune on the way to achieving official fame. Often a scholar faces his own shadow with a sigh, alone with the fact of his lack of success. He wants to stand straight and proud despite his skinny figure, for only he knows what emotions he has felt. He sighs about his shabby appearance when snobbish officials and wicked persons come to tease him. If he fails in his examinations time after time, others will regard every white hair on his head to be ugly. If he fails to become the top examinee, his compositions will be criticized unceasingly.\n\n“Among the people past and present who have had ample reason to weep, Ye was just like Bian He. When the white is mixed with the black, who then can serve as Bo Le? Nowadays no one cherishes intelligent people, so there’s no use expecting your mind to amount to anything. Look around yourself, there’s no place to settle down. In this life, there’s no need for a man to be serious and clear-minded all the time. You just close your eyes and walk your own way. Let heaven dispose of everything.\n\n“There are a lot of people in the world like Scholar Ye. But how can they find a friend like Ding, who’ll follow them regardless of life and death? Alas!”",

        "body": "In Wendeng, there was a man named Zhou, who in his younger days had been a student, sharing pen and ink-stone with a fellow named Cheng, with whom he became a sworn brother in friendship, regardless of wealth or lack of it. But Cheng was destitute, so he always had to depend upon Zhou. Since Zhou, the older of the two, acted as his elder brother, Cheng called Zhou’s wife his sister-in-law. During the annual festivals, the Chengs went to visit the Zhous as if they were all part of the same family.\n\nZhou’s wife gave birth to a son, but contracted a sudden post-natal illness and died. Subsequently he married a woman named Wang, and Cheng, because she was younger than him, didn’t formally request to meet her.\n\nOne day, her younger brother came to see her and was being banqueted in an inner room. Cheng arrived just then. A servant reported Cheng’s presence and Zhou ordered that he be invited in. But Cheng didn’t want to intrude, so he left. Zhou moved the banquet outside, sending someone to fetch him, so he returned. They had barely been seated when someone suddenly reported that a servant of the family had been seriously caned at the order of the local magistrate.\n\nWhat had happened was that a servant of the Huang family had been herding cattle when he crossed over into Zhou’s fields. The servants of both families had exchanged insults as a result of this. The cattle herder had hurried away to inform his master, who’d had the Zhou family servant arrested and sent to the magistrate, and after being declared guilty, he’d been caned as punishment.\n\nZhou ferreted out the details of the incident, blew up and exclaimed, “That Huang family’s pig and cattle herder—how dare he do that! Huang’s ancestor served my grandfather before; because of this, his family prospered, now no one else is as important in his eyes!” Anger filling his throat and chest, he stood up to go in search of Huang.\n\nBut Cheng restrained him, delaying him long enough to say, “Bullies run the world, giving no heed to what’s wrong or right. Furthermore, aren’t half of the officials in power nowadays bloody thieves who can’t even handle a spear or bow?” Zhou refused to listen. Cheng advised him another three times to stop, but it was only when his tears began falling silently that Zhou finally gave in. His anger, however, didn’t end there, so he tossed and turned all night long.\n\nThe next day he called his family members together and said, “The Huang family has taken advantage of us and made us enemies, but let’s not talk about that. The magistrate is supposed to handle administration of this district, free of the influence of powerful families, and wherever there is a dispute, he must also work with both parties—so how could he simply respond like a dog being ordered to do something? I’ll file a complaint against Huang’s servant, too, and we’ll see how the magistrate deals with the other side.”\n\nHis family members were all up in arms, encouraging him at that moment, so he put his plans into action. He wrote out his accusation and went to see the magistrate, who tore it up and threw it away. Zhou, furious, verbally attacked the magistrate. The official, humiliated and angry, ordered him to be seized and tied up.\n\nIn the morning, Cheng went to visit Zhou, and found that he’d gone into the city to manage the lawsuit. He swiftly ran after him to persuade him to desist, but by the time he’d arrived, Zhou had already been jailed. He stamped his foot in frustration at not being able to offer some help.\n\nAt the time, three pirates had been arrested, so the magistrate and Huang decided to bribe them to claim that Zhou was a member of their gang. Seizing on their words, the magistrate appealed to his superiors to strike Zhou’s name from the list of successful civil service examinees and had him cruelly beaten.\n\nWhen Cheng entered the prison to see him, they just looked at each other, miserable and sad. Cheng thought about appealing directly to the royal court. Zhou declared, “My body’s bound and imprisoned like a bird in a cage; though I do have a younger brother, it’s all he can do just to supply me with rice.”\n\nCheng, stepping up to take the responsibility on himself, said, “It’s my duty. If a friend won’t help when times are hard, what use is he?” With that, he left. Zhou’s younger brother gave Cheng a fee sufficient to cover his costs, and he traveled a long time before reaching his destination.\n\nOnce he’d arrived at the capital, he found no way to submit his appeal. However, it was reported that the emperor would participate in a hunt outside the palace, so Cheng hid himself ahead of time in the woods; when the emperor passed through, he prostrated himself, crying piteously, and succeeded in submitting his appeal. The emperor accepted his request. It was delivered to a courier’s station, which sent it on to a judicial department, where it would be reviewed.\n\nIt was ten months afterward that it was reviewed, by which time Zhou had already confessed to the false accusations and received a death sentence. The court officials were quite shocked to receive the emperor’s comments, and determined to hear the case again personally. Huang was also shocked, and made plans to kill Zhou. With this in mind, he bribed the jailers to cut off Zhou’s food and drink; when his younger brother arrived with supplies and asked about him, he was callously turned away.\n\nOnce again for Zhou’s sake, Cheng went to public officials to make the injustice known, and by the time his suffering was discovered and investigated, he was already so starved he was unable to stand. The investigating officials, furious, had the jailers caned to death. Huang, terribly frightened by this, paid out thousands in gold to be let off, and due to softened descriptions of his guilt, he was exempted from punishment. The magistrate, however, was banished for bending the laws. Zhou was set free to return home, feeling closer than ever to Cheng.\n\nAfter enduring the justice system, Cheng’s feelings for mundane concerns were reduced to ashes, and he invited Zhou to join him in withdrawing from the world. Zhou, powerfully attracted to his young wife, consequently laughed at the absurdity of the notion. Leaving everything behind, Cheng went missing for several days.\n\nZhou sent someone to find out from Cheng’s family how he was, but his family members were just as much in the dark as Zhou; since neither family had seen him, it began to look suspicious. Zhou thought to himself about Cheng’s odd suggestion and sent people to search for traces or clues of his whereabouts in all the area monasteries and temples. From time to time he also provided money and clothing out of compassion for Cheng’s son.\n\nIt was eight or nine years later that Cheng suddenly returned, wearing a yellow scarf and robe, with the dignified appearance of a Daoist. Zhou, overjoyed, grasped his arm and asked, “Where did you go, sir, for I’ve sent people everywhere looking for you?”\n\nLaughing, Cheng answered, “The lone cloud and the wild crane stay in no single place. Since I left all this behind, it has been my good fortune to become healthy and strong.” Zhou ordered some wine for them and summarized all that had happened since they’d been separated for so long, hoping to get Cheng to drop his Daoist appearance. Cheng smiled but didn’t speak.\n\nZhou exclaimed, “Don’t be so foolish! How can you throw away your wife and child like a pair of worn-out sandals?”\n\nCheng smiled and answered, “That’s not correct. It is other men who wish to throw me away, not I who wish to throw away others.” Zhou asked him where he’d been living, and he explained that he’d taken up residence on Mt. Lao in the Palace of the Sublime Silence.\n\nAfter drinking together, as the two of them went to sleep with their feet side-by-side, Zhou dreamed that Cheng was naked and lying on top of his chest, making it so he couldn’t catch his breath. Nervously, Zhou asked him what he was doing, yet he didn’t respond. Suddenly he woke up in alarm, calling out to Cheng without receiving an answer; he sat up and reached over for him, but he’d disappeared, and Zhou had no idea where he’d gone.\n\nOnce he’d had time to settle down, he became aware that he was on Cheng’s side of the bed, and, surprised, declared, “I wasn’t drunk last night, so through what craziness did I get over here?” Then he called for his household servants. The servants brought a light and revealed that he looked just like Cheng. Zhou had worn a beard for a long time, so he went to stroke it with his hand but found only a few thin hairs.\n\nHe grabbed a mirror and looked at his reflection, exclaiming in wonder, “This is Cheng alright—so where did _I_ go?” He stopped, finally grasping the situation, and realized that Cheng had used magic to try to lure him into leaving the world behind. He wanted to go back inside his room, but his younger brother saw that he didn’t have his brother’s familiar face and forbade him to enter, refusing to listen to him as before. Zhou was also unable to verify his own identity. At once, he ordered a servant to bring a horse and accompany him in search of Cheng.\n\nSeveral days later, they came upon Mt. Lao. The horse was making such good time that the servant was unable to keep up. Zhou stopped under a tree and watched a great many Daoist priests coming and going. Among them was one Daoist who kept his eye on Zhou, so Zhou decided to ask him about Cheng. The Daoist priest smiled and said, “I’ve heard his name—he’s probably in the Palace of Sublime Silence.” When he finished speaking, he proceeded on his way.\n\nZhou kept an eye on him, watching him the distance of an arrow’s flight, until he stopped to speak to another person, also exchanging just a few words before heading off again. When the person who’d been spoken to approached him, Zhou realized he was from the same community of students of which Cheng and he had once been part.\n\nWhen he saw Zhou, the man remarked, “I haven’t seen you face-to-face for several years, but people maintained that you’d come to the mountain to study Daoism—so why are you still playing around in the mundane world?” Zhou told him about his strange experience. Alarmed, the man replied, “I just met and spoke with a fellow I took to be you. He left just a little bit ago, so he probably hasn’t gone far.”\n\nZhou was really shaken by this and exclaimed, “That can’t be! How could I meet myself and not recognize my own face?” His servant caught up with him and they anxiously rushed off, but finally there were no traces or signs of Cheng. As they looked out over a vast expanse, they couldn’t make their minds up whether to go forward or back. But Zhou thought about the fact that he no longer had a family he could return to, hence he resolved to continue his pursuit. The road, however, was quite dangerous, and he couldn’t ride around it, so he handed his horse over to his servant and sent him back, taking the winding path himself.\n\nIn the distance he saw a boy sitting by himself, so he hastened to approach and explain his purpose, introducing himself and his objective. The boy identified himself as Cheng’s pupil, lifted Zhou’s clothes and provisions onto his back, and led them on their way. They ate by starlight and slept in the open, traveling high and low while covering great distances, until after three days they arrived—but this place they call Sublime Silence isn’t like a place called Sublime Silence in the world. Although it was already into the tenth month of the year, mountain flowers lined the road, not at all like the beginning of winter.\n\nThe boy entered to announce his guest, and Cheng at once hurried out; only then did Zhou recognize his own body. Cheng clasped his hand and together they entered a place where there was wine and food, then began a conversation. Zhou had observed a number of strangely colored birds, so docile that they weren’t frightened by people, with voices like pan-pipes, that would land at times on a seat and begin singing. He found this very unusual. This mortal life, however, cut into his thoughts. and he had no intention of asking to stay and join in.\n\nOn the ground there was a pair of kneeling mats made of rushes, placed there so they could sit side-by-side. The two sat there for four hours until all of their thoughts were stilled, when suddenly Zhou thought he’d take a short nap and felt his body change places with Cheng’s. Curious, he stroked the bottom of his chin and found his beard there as before. By dawn, all he could think about was returning. Cheng, however, insisted that he stay.\n\nAfter three days he declared, “Get yourself some sleep, and in the early morning I’ll see you off on your way.”\n\nJust as he’d shut his eyes, Zhou heard Cheng call to him, “Go get dressed, we’re all ready.” So he got up and followed him.\n\nThey went along a different road than the one he’d previously taken. Zhou was aware that although little time had passed, he could already see his village and home in the distance. Cheng sat to wait by the side of the road in order that Zhou could go on by himself. Zhou tried earnestly, but couldn’t get him to accompany him, so he walked on alone to his family’s gate.\n\nHe knocked but received no answer, so he determined to climb over the wall, suddenly feeling as though his body could float like a leaf—and with a single leap he was over it. Altogether, he passed over several walls this way, only then arriving at the sleeping quarters, where he noticed the lamp still shining and heard the people inside, not yet asleep, murmuring to each other. Making a hole in the paper window to spy through it, he saw his wife drinking together with a male servant in quite improper, even indecent, condition.\n\nThis made him burn with anger; he calculated to himself and was about to mount a surprise attack to catch them, but then worried that, alone, he might not be able to overcome the two of them. Hence he surreptitiously unbolted a door and slipped out, rushing off to tell Cheng and to ask his assistance.\n\nAgreeing to accompany him, Cheng followed as they went inside, straight to the bedroom. Zhou picked up a rock and beat on the door, while inside they were extremely panicked; as the pounding became more and more insistent, they worked all the harder inside to barricade the entrance. Cheng made a motion with his sword, and with a stroke promptly broke the door open. Zhou rushed inside, then the servant burst through the doorway, running. Cheng was waiting outside and struck the servant with his sword, cutting off his arm and shoulder.\n\nZhou held the wife so he could interrogate her, and learned that she had been having an intimate relationship with the servant since he had been imprisoned. Zhou borrowed Cheng’s sword and cut off her head, then strung up her intestines between trees in the courtyard. After all this, he followed Cheng outside, where they searched for the road and made their return.\n\nAll of a sudden, he woke up and found his body still lying in bed, terrified, and declared, “What a strange dream I’ve just experienced, enough to really startle a person!”\n\nCheng, laughing, replied, “Your dream, elder brother, you’ve treated as truth, when clearly you regard the truth as only a dream.” Zhou, still shaken, asked what he meant. Cheng took out his sword and showed him that it was still spattered with blood. Zhou, frightened and distressed, was ready to end it all—though he still privately suspected that it was just Cheng trying to persuade him again with his magic. Cheng knew what he was thinking and hastened to send him back home.\n\nIn no time at all, they arrived at the village gate, where Cheng said, “Outside here I waited for you that night, and relied upon my sword! Wasn’t this the place? It disgusts me to look upon the evil and filth of the place, so please go on, sir, while I wait for you here; if you have not returned by afternoon meal time, I will leave by myself.”\n\nZhou then walked up to his home and found it deserted, as if no one was living there. Then he went and entered his younger brother’s house. When the brother saw him, he immediately broke down in tears, crying, “After you left, elder brother, thieves in the night killed your wife, then ripped out her guts and left—such grievous cruelty. To date, the officials haven’t caught them.”\n\nTo Zhou, it was as if he was waking from a dream again, so he explained his situation to him, warning him not to pursue the matter any further. The brother was shocked speechless for quite some time. Zhou asked him about his son, then ordered an old woman to bring him to them. Zhou explained to his brother, “This infant is our clan’s connection to posterity, so look after him well. Your elder brother longs to take his leave of this mortal world.” Then he stood up and went away.\n\nThe younger Zhou, in tears, raced to catch up with him, but Zhou continued without looking back. When they got to the outskirts of the village, he watched Cheng leave with his brother. In the distance, Zhou turned back to look at him and called out, “If you just bear with things, you’ll be the most happy.” The younger brother wanted to have a few words with him, but Cheng raised one of his broad sleeves and instantly they were gone from sight. Disappointed, he stood there for some time, bitterly crying, before turning back.\n\nZhou’s younger brother was simple and dull, not very good at managing the family’s property, and over the next several years the family became increasingly impoverished. Zhou’s son by then was growing up, and Zhou’s younger brother wasn’t able to hire a teacher for him, and for this reason Zhou’s son taught himself to study.\n\nOne morning, his uncle entered his study room, and at the head of a table he saw that there was a letter, sealed very securely, inscribed “To be opened by our clan’s second born.” He examined it, noting that it was written in his brother’s handwriting; upon opening it to inspect its contents, he found it was empty except for a fingernail, about as long as two fingers. He found this quite odd. He put the fingernail down on the ink-stone, then went out to ask other household members where it had come from, but no one knew.\n\nWhen he returned to look at it, the ink-stone on the table was gleaming magnificently, having been changed into pure gold. He was utterly amazed. He tried another piece of metal on it, and it also turned into gold. As a result of this, they became very wealthy. Therefore he bestowed 1,000 taels of gold on Cheng’s son, for which reason, word got around that the two families had learned the magic of transmuting gold.",

        "body": "In Jiangnan, there was a virtuous person named Mei Xiaolian, whose courtesy name was Ouchang. He said that his countryman, Sun, being the magistrate formerly in Dezhou county, had once investigated an extraordinary case.\n\nIt all began with a village man who arranged a marriage for his son, and when the bridegroom arrived and entered the gate, his neighbors and relatives all joined in to celebrate his wedding, lavishing their congratulations on him. They drank together until midnight, when the bridegroom briefly stepped outside and saw his bride, dazzlingly dressed, turn and hurriedly dash behind the house. This made him suspicious, so he tailed her.\n\nBehind the residence, there was a long creek with a small bridge over it. He saw his bride cross the bridge and slip away quickly, increasing his suspicions. He shouted to her, but she didn’t answer.\n\nIn the distance, she beckoned to her husband with her hand; he ran anxiously to follow her, but there remained a distance between them so he couldn’t reach her. He pursued her for several _li_ till he came to a village. The wife stopped and said to her husband, “Your family is dull and too quiet, and I’m not used to it. Please take up temporary residence as the master of my family’s household for a few days, then we can return together after a visit.”\n\nWhen she finished speaking, she took the pins out of her hair and knocked at a door, pounding until a small girl servant came to answer it. The wife entered first. Without any other choice, the husband followed her. Once inside, he found his father-in-law and mother-inlaw waiting for him in the household’s central hall.\n\nThey called out to the son-in-law, “Our daughter’s been spoiled, never experiencing a quarter hour away from her parents, so when she left for your home, we all felt sad and missed her. Now that she and her lord have arrived, our missing her has been eased and consoled. Stay with us for several days, then we’ll see you two off properly for your return.” Certain rooms were appointed for them then, a bed and mattress was prepared, and so they settled in.\n\nWhen the family and guests of the bridegroom noticed that he hadn’t returned, they went out to look for him. They checked in the house where the bride had been staying, but no one there knew where the husband had gone. Because of this they made inquiries about him far and near, but were unable to gather any news of him. The groom’s aged parents shed tears, believing he must be dead.\n\nMeanwhile, after about half a year had passed, the wife’s family was grieving that their daughter had lost her spouse, so they went to consult his father, the village man, wishing him to determine whether their daughter could remarry. The father made them even more upset by exclaiming, “No clothes or a skeleton of my son have been identified, so how can you supposedly know that he’s already died! But even if he’d died suddenly, waiting a year before getting married again isn’t too much; you’re acting recklessly to be so impatient!”\n\nThe wife and her father became angrier when they heard the village man’s words, and they brought the case to the magistrate and sued him. Magistrate Sun was quite skeptical and wished not to mishandle his authority, so he made his ruling and ordered them to wait for three years, then put it on public record and sent them away.\n\nMeanwhile, the villager’s son was still dwelling with his wife’s family, and the family members treated him very well. Every time he proposed to take his wife and leave, the wife would give her consent for him to do so, but then procrastinated so they never actually got around to leaving. After more than half a year, he became more agitated in mind about having stayed there too long. He wanted to return home alone, but his wife insisted that he stay.\n\nOne day, the whole family appeared scared, as if some kind of disaster was impending. The father-inlaw hastily told his son-in-law, “The original plan was in two or three days to send you and your wife together on your way. Despite our expectations, things haven’t been prepared properly, because our family has suffered some hardships. We have no choice but to send you back home alone first.”\n\nThereupon, he accompanied the husband as he left through the gate, and following his hasty farewells, he returned quickly in no time at all. Afterwards, the villager’s son wanted to retrace the route he’d followed, and when he went back to look at the house and yard, they were no longer there: in their place he saw a tall grave mound. Terribly frightened, he located his path and hurriedly came back.\n\nUpon his arrival at home, he told about everything that had happened to him, from beginning to end, and for that reason was encouraged to send the magistrate his statement. Master Sun detained the bride’s father, issuing a decree that he send his daughter back to the man she’d married, so they could finally join their nuptial winecups in a toast.",

There was also an old man who lived temporarily in the temple till he found that he had the same hobby as the priest, so they became good friends. The old man ended up living there for several years, and on each memorial day honoring people’s ancestors, he would leave ten days early, and then come back once the memorial activities were concluded. The Daoist priest became curious and asked him about his reason for doing so.\n\nThe old man replied, “We two have no secrets from each other, so I can tell you honestly: I’m really a fox. When memorial day arrives, all sorts of gods come out to clean away evil things. I have no place to stay then, so I run somewhere and hide myself.”\n\nAfter another year, the memorial day arrived again and he went out, but after a long time he didn’t return. The priest became concerned.\n\nOne day, the old man suddenly returned. The priest asked him what had happened. By way of answer, he explained, “I almost didn’t make it back to see you! I’d been wanting to keep my distance from them but was quite careless about it, so when I spotted a covering over a cavity that was very well concealed, and was satisfied that it was out of sight, I hid in a small jug underneath it.\n\n“I didn’t expect the magistrate of the heavenly and mortal worlds to come here to take part in the cleaning.

I jumped into the water and washed repeatedly, then went into seclusion and hid in a cave for many, many days, filthy and greasy, only eventually able to get clean.\n\n“Now that I’ve arrived to say farewell to you before departing, you’d also better become a hermit somewhere else: a calamity’s about to arrive here and this is not a blessed place.” His speech finished, he took his leave and moved on.\n\nThe Daoist priest complied with his words and went elsewhere.

        "body": "In Lijin, Wang Lan suddenly took sick and died. When the Hell King checked his record of Wang’s death, he determined that one of his demon minions had mistakenly crossed out Wang’s name and that’s why Wang died suddenly. The demon was reprimanded and charged to return Wang’s spirit to his body, but his corpse had already decomposed.\n\nFearing he’d be punished for his mistake, the demon spoke to Wang: “For a person to die and become a spirit is bitterly sad, but for a spirit to become an immortal is cause for celebration. And if one is happy, what’s the need to return to the mortal world?”\n\nWang thought there was some truth in this. The demon continued, “There’s a certain fox who has succeeded in producing an immortality pill. You can steal the pill and gulp it down, then your spirit won’t dissipate and you’ll be able to live forever. No matter where you go, you can do as you wish. Won’t you agree to accept this advice?”\n\nWang followed his suggestions. The demon led him out and they entered a vast mansion where they could see grand pavilion towers, but it was silent and no people were around. A fox was there sitting under the moon, his head raised, looking up into the sky. He exhaled a breath, till a pill came out of his mouth and rocketed straight up to the moon; when he inhaled, the pill fell back down, and the fox took it into his mouth, practicing this over and over again.\n\nThe demon hid at the fox’s side, waited for him to spit the pill out, then swiftly grabbed it in his hand and turned it over to Wang to swallow. The surprised fox, exploding in rage, turned to face them. Seeing there were two of them, the fox, realizing that the difference between his strength and the others’ would guarantee that he would lose a fight, expressed his rancor and left.\n\nWang took his leave of the demon and rejoined his family, but when his wife and son saw him, they were thoroughly frightened and ran away. Wang announced what had happened to him, and then gradually they assembled around him. After this, the family was finally able to rest easy, and things got back to normal.\n\nWhen Wang’s friend, Zhang, heard the news and came to visit him, they exchanged their normal greetings. Afterwards Wang said to Zhang, “Our families have been poor for as long as I can remember, but now I have some magic and can make us rich. Would you be able to go on a trip with me?” Zhang said he could. Wang explained, “I can cure maladies without using medicine, and ascertain the future without resorting to fortune-telling. I wanted to appear in my own body, but I’m afraid that those who know me would be terrified by the strangeness of it. I could attach my spirit to your body—would you approve of that?” Zhang again gave his consent. That same day they hastened to pack and traveled west till they arrived at the border of Shanxi Province.\n\nIn a wealthy home, they found a daughter who had become sick suddenly, and after feeling dizzy had then slipped into a coma. Her family had already tried everything from medicine to sacrifices aimed at averting evil, so Zhang went up to the house, bragging about his magic. The rich old man only had this one daughter, whom he considered very precious, so he announced his desire to give anyone able to cure her a thousand taels.\n\nZhang asked to examine her. He followed the old man into the house and saw the daughter, her eyes shut, lying in bed; when he lifted the large quilt from her and rubbed her body, the comatose daughter showed no sign of feeling it. Wang privately told Zhang, “This shows that her spirit has been lost, so I should go hunt for it.”\n\nZhang then informed the old man, “Though her illness is life-threatening, I can save her.”\n\n“What medicine do you need?” the old man asked.\n\nZhang’s words made it clear that this wasn’t necessary. “Your daughter’s spirit, sir, has gone to another place, so I’ve already dispatched a deity to locate it.”\n\nAbout an hour later, Wang suddenly returned, reporting that he’d already found her. Zhang then requested that the old man allow him back into the daughter’s room, and he massaged her body again. In a little while, the daughter yawned and opened her eyes abruptly. The old man was overjoyed, hugging her and asking how she was.\n\nThe daughter explained, “I’d been playing in the garden when I saw a young gentleman holding a slingshot and shooting at sparrows; several others leading fine horses followed behind him. I nervously wanted to run away from them, but they stopped me from doing so. The young gentleman then handed me his slingshot and taught me how to shoot it. Just as I was feeling shy and was about to complain to him, he pulled me up onto his horse and we rode off.\n\n“Laughing, he said, ‘I’m happy to have you to play with, so don’t feel shy.’\n\n“Several _li_ later, we entered the mountains, but from horseback I howled all kinds of abuse at him; this made the young gentleman angry, so he pushed me off and I fell down beside the road, wanting to go home but not knowing the way.\n\n“Just then a man arrived, grabbed me by the arm, and we sped away, till in the blink of an eye I was home so quickly that it’s as though I just awoke from a dream.” After hearing his daughter’s words, the old man treated Zhang like a supernatural being, and handed over the thousand taels.\n\nWang discussed things with Zhang that night, suggesting that they keep two hundred taels for their use while traveling, then he took the remainder home, knocked on the door, and handed them over to his son; he also directed his son to give three hundred taels as a gift to Zhang’s family, then he returned. The next day, when they took their leave of the old man, he couldn’t see where they could’ve stored all the money, which only added to the strangeness of it all, so he generously gave them other gifts as well, and then saw them off.\n\nSeveral days later, Zhang was in the suburbs when he ran into a fellow villager named He Cai. Cai was a drinker and gambler who wouldn’t work, and hence was as poor as a beggar. He’d heard that Zhang had obtained some rare magic and had used it to make money without working for it, so he’d rushed off to look for him. Wang suggested that Zhong give him some small amount of money, and then send him back.\n\nCai didn’t modify his usual pattern, so in just ten days of debauchery, he’d spent it all and came looking again for Zhang. Wang had anticipated this and said, “Cai is undisciplined and contrary, so you shouldn’t try to support him very much—just give him a suitable bribe and send him away, and though this makes you party to his activities, your guilt is pretty minimal.”\n\nThe following day, Cai arrived as predicted, intrusively following Zhang everywhere. Zhang declared to him, “I knew from the start that you’d be back. Your daily routine is drinking and gambling, so why should even a thousand taels fill your bottomless pit? If you’re sincere about changing your ways, I’ll offer you a hundred taels as a present.”\n\nCai promised he would change.\n\nZhang emptied his money bag and conferred the contents on him. Cai left with the hundred taels in his own bag, and gambled even more unrestrainedly; in addition, he visited the brothels, squandering money like it was as common as dirt.\n\nIn town, the constables became suspicious and arrested him, taking him before the local magistrate, where he was subjected to flogging and other brutal cruelties. Cai told them the truth about the source of his money. Subordinates were then dispatched to take Cai with them and arrest Zhang. In a few days, due to his wounds, Cai died while en route. His spirit still wouldn’t leave Zhang alone, returning to follow him around as he had previously, which is how he came to meet Wang.\n\nOne day, while they were all drinking together on a mound in the mist, Cai got crazy drunk and started shouting, and though Wang tried to stop him, he wouldn’t listen. By chance, an imperial representative, making an inspection, was passing through when he heard the shouting, and went to investigate, discovering Zhang alone. Zhang, frightened of the man’s power, told the truth about everything. The imperial representative was furious at this tale, had Zhang flogged, and sent a memorial to the gods.\n\nThat night, the imperial representative dreamed that a person dressed in gold armor appeared to him and said, “We have examined the case of Wang Lan, who was innocent but died anyway and now has become an immortal spirit. The practice of medicine is a benevolent use of magic, and should not be punished as an evil or demonism. So now I’m presenting the Heaven King’s command: he is to be granted the posthumous title of Minister of Street-Sweeping. He Cai is evil and debauched, so for his punishment his spirit will be exiled to Tiewei Mountain. Zhang is certainly not guilty, and hence should be pardoned.” The imperial representative woke up and marveled at the dream, then released Zhang.\n\nZhang packed his belongings and returned to his village. In his bag he still had a few hundred taels, and he respectfully offered half of them to Wang’s family. From this point forward, the Wang clan’s children and grandchildren grew to be wealthy.",

        "body": "Wang Cheng, son of a venerable family in Pingyuan, was by nature extraordinarily lazy. His limited resources declined until he had nothing left but a ramshackle house with a couple rooms, and he had only a coarse blanket to lie beneath with his wife, who complained that she couldn’t bear it.\n\nAt the time, it was summer and very hot, and outside the village was the Zhou family’s old park, where the walls had all collapsed, and only a pavilion remained; many other villagers were going there to spend the night, so Wang joined them.\n\nWhen daybreak came, the other sleepers all left; the sun had been up about three hours when Wang finally got up and sluggishly went along his way. In the grass, he spotted a gold hairpin, and when he picked it up to examine it, he noticed some delicate characters on it that read, “made by the family of the imperial son-in-law.” Wang’s grandfather had married into the imperial family, hence his family had owned such things, many with the same inscriptions, so his thoughts were preoccupied as he held the hairpin.\n\nSuddenly an old woman showed up, looking for the hairpin. Even though Wang was poor, he was honorable by nature, so he promptly took it out and gave it to her. The old woman was pleased and magnanimously praised him for his great virtue, saying, “The hairpin’s value is modest, except that it was something left behind by my late husband.”\n\nHe asked her, “Who was your husband?”\n\n“He was the former imperial son-in-law, Wang Jianzhi,” she replied.\n\nWang, startled, sputtered, “My own grandfather. How did you two meet?”\n\nThe old woman, equally surprised, wondered aloud, “So you’re really Wang Jianzhi’s grandson? I’m a fox fairy. A century ago, I was the beloved of your noble grandfather. When he died, I went into seclusion. Passing through this place, I lost the hairpin, which fortunately fell into his grandson’s hands, so it must have been fated!”\n\nWang had already heard about his grandfather having had a fox for a wife, so he trusted her words and invited her to come for a visit. The old woman followed him.\n\nWang called to his wife to come out and see her, and she came out wearing ratty clothing, looking emaciated. The old woman sighed, “Oh! That a grandson of Wang Jianzhi should have arrived at such a state of poverty!” She also noticed no smoke coming from their decrepit stove, and asked, “With your household in such a condition, how do you manage just to stay alive?” Wang’s wife then quietly narrated the facts of their poverty, accompanied by choking sobs of deep sorrow.\n\nThe old woman took out the hairpin and gave it to her, bidding her to exchange it for money at the market to buy rice, and revealed that in three days she would return to see them. Wang begged her to stay. The old woman replied, “You’re unable to keep your own wife alive; if I were to remain, dependent on your house and home, how would that make things any better for you?” Having had her say, she went off on her way.\n\nWhen Wang told his wife who she was, she became alarmed. But Wang was insistent in reciting her generous qualities, and asked her to treat the old woman as her own grandmother, so she agreed to do so.\n\nIn three days, consequently, the old woman returned. She took out some money so they could buy a large weight each of millet and wheat. That night, she shared a small bed with Wang’s wife. At first the wife was afraid of her; but upon considering how extremely supportive she had been of them, she abandoned her doubts.\n\nThe next day, the old woman told Wang, “Don’t be lazy, grandson; you should conduct a little business to make a living, earn your keep and grow up!” Wang reported that he had no money to do this. She responded, “In your grandfather’s time, there was gold and silk for the taking; but since I wasn’t human, I had no need for such things, so I didn’t take much. I accumulated forty taels in gold from my gleanings, but up till now it’s just been stored away. For a long time I’ve been hoarding it, since there was no use for it, but I’m going to give it to you so you can go to the market and buy lightweight cloth, then take it to the capital where you can make a modest profit on it.”\n\nWang obeyed her, purchased over fifty units of the cloth, then returned. The old woman directed him to make haste and load up, calculating that in six or seven days he could easily reach the capital. By way of advice, she also admonished him, “You must be diligent, not lazy; expedient, not tardy—if you’re a day late, you’ll regret that you stopped for the night!” Wang respectfully took her advice, packed his merchandise into bags, and then hit the road.\n\nAlong the way, he ran into a rainstorm that soaked his clothing and shoes. In all his life, Wang had never undergone such hardship and was so worn-out that he couldn’t bear it, so he took a short break from his travels at an inn. Unexpectedly, the rain kept pouring through the night, cascading off the eaves like ropes.\n\nBy the next day, conditions outside had become extremely messy. He watched people going and coming, dragging themselves through mud up to their shins, and knew he couldn’t face such suffering. He decided to wait to go out until it stopped, and about midday it began to dry up—but dark clouds returned to shut out the daylight, the rain again coming down heavily. He stayed one more night and then left.\n\nAs he was getting close to the capital, he overheard that the price for lightweight cloth had skyrocketed, so he felt privately thrilled. Upon entering the capital, he stopped to register at an inn, where the host explained it was a great pity that he’d arrived late. Earlier on, before the southern route had opened up, very little lightweight cloth had been getting through. An affluent, influential prince had been extremely anxious to buy some, so its price suddenly soared to three times its norm. On the previous day, the prince’s family had purchased all they needed, and everyone coming since then had been disappointed. Thus the host broke the news to him. Wang’s beautiful merchandise would not bring in the money he’d hoped for it.\n\nEach day, more and more lightweight cloth arrived, so its price continued to plummet. Wang could make no profit, but he refused to sell it at a loss. He waited for ten days, until the expenses for his boarding were calculated, greatly increasing his depression. His host encouraged him to sell, even at a loss, to make a change and formulate another plan. Wang followed his advice. He lost another ten taels this way as he unloaded his stock.\n\nAt sunrise, just as he was planning to leave, he looked into the bag holding his money and found his taels were gone. Alarmed, he told the host, but there was nothing he could do about their loss. Others there encouraged him to file an official complaint, making it the responsibility of the host to compensate him. Wang sighed and said, “This is just my fate, so why should it involve the host?”\n\nThe host, hearing this and admiring his ethics, offered him five taels as a present, enough to allow him to be sent home. But Wang couldn’t stand the thought of facing his grandmother, so he paced back and forth, inside and outside, advancing and retreating, stuck in his predicament.\n\nJust then, he noticed that a fellow who managed fighting quails was raking in money from all the betting on them; each bet brought in a thousand coins, but the cost of buying a quail was just over a hundred coins. The notion suddenly struck him to use the money now in his bag, which was just enough to begin dealing in quails, and so he discussed his idea with the host. The host earnestly supported his plan, and in addition arranged to “loan” him room and board without taking anything directly from him.\n\nIt was a happy Wang who went out then. He bought a load of surplus quails, then reentered the capital. The host was pleased for him, congratulating him and suggesting he sell them quickly. It rained heavily all that night until dawn. By first light, the thoroughfares were like rivers, and it was still raining without sign of letting up. Wang stayed inside, waiting and watching. It continued like this for several days, without ceasing.\n\nWhen he went out to look inside his bamboo baskets, he discovered that some of the quails had been gradually dying. Wang was very upset, but didn’t know what to do about it and finally left them. By the following day, several more had died; only a couple of them remained alive, so he combined them in a single basket and fed them. When the night had passed, he went out to look in on them and found only a single quail still alive.\n\nHe told the host what had happened, unable to stop his tears from falling. The host shared his disappointment. Wang, realizing that since he’d spent all the money he couldn’t afford to go home, just wanted to die, so the host did his best to console him. Together they went to check on the quail, and upon carefully examining it, the host said, “This seems to be a superior specimen. The other quails all died not through misfortune, but because this one killed them. Sir, since you’re currently free and have no other pressing affairs, I’d encourage you to train it; once he’s ready, you can make a living by gambling with him.” Wang acted as advised.\n\nAs soon as the quail had been trained, the host directed him to take it out to the streets, first to gamble just for drinks and snacks. The quail’s body was strong and it always won. The host, pleased, gave Wang some money, sending him back out to gamble with some local young men; in three bouts, he scored three wins. After about half a year, he’d accumulated twenty taels. His mind was greatly relieved, and he began to think of the quail as his livelihood.\n\nIt just so happened that one of the princes loved quail fights, and each year during the Lantern Festival he would bring local quail trainers together at the palace to hold a competition. The host told Wang, “Now, with his great wealth, he should be able to set you up; but what’s unclear is what is going to happen thanks to your unlucky fate.” He then explained to him all about it, directing Wang to go with him. He advised Wang, “If you lose, let everyone hear how despondent you feel. If instead you’re the fortunate one, and your quail achieves victory, the prince will surely wish to buy it—but sir, do not agree to do so; if he’s firm in his insistence, check to see if I’m nodding my head, and wait for my nod before you answer him.”\n\nWang said, “I promise.”\n\nWhen they arrived at the palace, the quail-handlers were already bumping into each other’s shoulders at the foot of the palace steps. In an instant, the prince stepped forth from the palace. To his right and left, heralds proclaimed, “Let those who wish to fight come up.” At once, a man holding a quail hastened to advance. The prince ordered his own quail released and the challenger also released his; at the first contact, the challenger’s quail was stopped cold. The prince laughed heartily. In no time, he went on to defeat many other handlers.\n\nThe host told Wang, “You can do it.” Then they went up together.\n\nThe prince remarked to them, “Its eyes pulse with anger, its feathers are robust—we mustn’t treat this enemy lightly.” He ordered his quail, Iron Beak, to be brought in for the match. Once, and then a second time, they leapt at each other, till the prince’s quail had its feathers knocked out. He had it replaced with a better bird, and after that exchange, it, too, was defeated.\n\nThe prince impatiently gave the order for his Jade Quail to be brought from inside the palace. A short while later it was brought out, displaying white feathers like a snowy heron’s, an extraordinary creature of outstanding appearance. Wang Cheng was terribly disheartened, so he kneeled and begged for the contests to end, pleading, “Great prince, your quail is a wonder—I fear it will wound my bird, depriving me of my livelihood.”\n\nThe prince smiled and said, “Get up. If it’s beaten in this contest and dies, I’ll compensate you appropriately.”\n\nWang then released his bird. The Jade Quail rushed straight for it. But when the Jade Quail came in close, Wang’s bird, like an angry chicken, was waiting for it; the Jade Quail had a strong beak, while Wang’s quail rose up like a soaring crane to strike; advancing and retreating, stiff-necked, they grabbed each other and struggled for some time.\n\nThe Jade Quail began to tire, which made Wang’s quail angrier and fiercer, so he fought with even greater intensity. It wasn’t long before snowy feathers began to fly, and with its wings hanging limply, the Jade Quail ran away. The myriad spectators couldn’t help but praise the display.\n\nThe prince himself then demanded to hold the bird, looking it over from beak to talons, scrutinizing it carefully, and then asked Wang, “Is this quail for sale?”\n\nHe answered him like this: “Since I’m a petty person without much permanent property, I’ve come to depend upon it as my livelihood, so I wouldn’t want to sell it.”\n\nThe prince replied, “I could give you a significant price, a middleman’s expected wages. Wouldn’t that be quite sufficient?”\n\nWang bowed and thought about this for a long time, then said, “I’m not happy about selling it; but if the great prince has already become fond of it and will give me in exchange the amount of money to obtain clothing and food, what more could I ask?”\n\nThe prince invited him to name his price, and he proposed a thousand taels. Laughing, the prince exclaimed, “Silly man! You think the quail’s a precious gem, but how can it be worth a thousand taels?”\n\n“The great prince doesn’t think it a gem,” Wang answered, “but I think it worthy of a Liancheng gem.”\n\nThe prince asked, “What makes it so valuable to you?”\n\nWang explained, “When I take it to the market district, every day it earns me a certain amount of money which I exchange for millet, enough to feed a family of more than ten, and to keep them from worrying about freezing, so is that not a precious thing?”\n\nThe prince answered, “You won’t sacrifice any of that with what I’ll give you—so I’ll make it two hundred taels.” Wang shook his head no. The prince increased his offer by another hundred. Wang looked at the host, whose expression hadn’t changed.\n\nThen he said, “Keeping in mind the great prince’s prestige, please feel free to reduce my asking price by a hundred.”\n\nThe prince cried, “Stop fooling around! Who’d be willing to pay nine hundred taels for a single quail?” Wang put his quail into his bag and began to leave. The prince blurted, “Come back, and I’ll actually give you six hundred—you can agree to sell it or not, but that’s it.” Wang again glanced at the host, who remained unchanged as before.\n\nWang was absolutely elated, but he feared that they might let the opportunity slip past, so he replied, “For this price I’ll sell, though in my heart I’m truly sad; I’m distressed to give up my quail, but not to do so might increase my hardships even further. Rather than end up with nothing, I’ll take the prince’s offer.” The prince was delighted and had payment turned over to Wang at once. Wang put the taels in his bag, paid his respects for the prince’s generosity, and left.\n\nThe host chided him, “I told you what to do, so why were you so anxious to sell? If you’d resisted a bit longer, you’d be holding eight hundred taels in your hands.”\n\nWang returned with him to the inn, tossed the taels on a table, and invited the host to collect his share, but he wouldn’t take anything. Wang made the offer more insistently, so the host checked his tab, figured up the cost of Wang’s meals, and accepted that amount.\n\nWang packed his bags to return, and when he arrived home, he described everything he’d done, then took out the money to show them—and they all celebrated together. The old woman directed him to purchase three hundred _mu_ of good farmland, to build a house, and to make some implements, and upon doing so, his family soon rose to prominence.\n\nThe old woman got up early each morning and sent Wang out to supervise the cultivating while his wife oversaw the weaving; if they ever behaved rather lazily, she roundly scolded them. Husband and wife lived peacefully together, no longer attempting to blame things on each other. Three years passed by with the family becoming increasingly more wealthy.\n\nThe old woman finally expressed the desire to take her leave of them. Wang and his wife together tried to dissuade her, until it brought them to tears. The old woman agreed to stay. But by sunrise the next morning, she had already vanished.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Riches are the consequence of living a zealous life; only in this case were they the consequence of laziness, which makes it an unprecedented situation. Wang didn’t know what to do about his extreme poverty, but he still retained his honest nature, which is why heaven at first abandoned him, and then, feeling pity, rescued him later. Thus wealth actually can come from being lazy!”",

        "body": "The Geng family of Taiyuan, because they were a powerful family, lived in a resplendent mansion. But once their affluence declined, half the house’s network of linked corridors were abandoned and neglected. From this sprung up weird accounts of hallway doors often opening and closing by themselves, and of family members constantly startled by noises in the night. This so troubled Geng, that he moved his household to a country villa and retained an old man to serve as watchman at the mansion’s gate.\n\nAfterwards, the estate fell into further neglect. At times, the sounds of laughter, talking, singing, and playing the flute came from inside. Geng had a nephew, named Qubing, wild and incorrigible, who instructed the old watchman to run and tell him if he heard or saw anything. One certain night, the old man saw lantern lights up in the house, appearing and then vanishing, so he ran to tell Qubing. He wanted to slip inside to spy on this strange activity. The watchman tried to stop him, but he wouldn’t listen.\n\nThe estate’s gates and doors were familiar in Qubing’s memory, but he had to follow a round-about path, poking through thickets of wormwood and fleabane before he could enter. He climbed to one of the upper floors without noticing anything particularly odd, then began to hear people speaking softly when he passed from one building into another. He stealthily peered around a corner and saw a tremendous pair of candles burning, shining as brightly as daylight.\n\nAn old man with a scholar’s cap sat at the south end of the room, together with an old woman opposite him, both well past their forties. On the east side, there was a young man, maybe about twenty; on his right was a young woman, whom Qubing judged to be about fifteen. Their table was loaded with meats and wine, and the group sat laughing and chatting. Qubing abruptly walked in, laughing, and cried, “Your uninvited guest has arrived!” The terrified group ran away to hide.\n\nBy himself, the old man came back, and in a scolding voice demanded, “Who do you think you are, entering people’s private rooms?”\n\nQubing answered, “These are my family’s rooms that you’re occupying. You’re drinking this excellent wine by yourselves without inviting the home’s owner—so why are you being so stingy?”\n\nThe old man, glancing cautiously at him, replied, “You’re not the owner.”\n\nQubing countered, “I’m the irrepressible scholar, Geng Qubing, nephew of the house’s owner.”\n\nThe old man respectfully exclaimed, “For a long time I’ve admired your impressive efforts!” Then bowing with hands clasped, he led Qubing to the table, calling to his servants to bring out different food. Qubing stopped him. The old man then poured wine for his guest.\n\nQubing remarked, “Our families have much in common, and those guests who were seated here have no reason to fear being seen, so I implore you to invite them to return and drink.”\n\nThe old man called out, “Xiao’er!” Instantly a young man reentered. “This is my son,” the old man explained. Xiao’er bowed respectfully to Qubing, and they sat down together, briefly surveying their families’ histories. The old man commented, “My surname was Hu.”\n\nQubing was his conventionally extroverted self, conversing of opinions and unusual customs, with Xiao’er also displaying a casual elegance and charm; pouring out their hearts to each other, they quickly became close friends. Qubing was twenty-one, making him two years older than Xiao’er, so he called him his “younger brother.”\n\n“I’ve heard,” the old man observed, “that your grandfather compiled _The Stories of Tushan_—do you know about that?”\n\nQubing replied, “I do know indeed.”\n\nThe old man reported, “I’m a descendant of the Tushan family. I can trace our family’s genealogy all the way back to the Tang dynasty; but from the Five Dynasties and earlier, we have no records. It would be my good fortune, sir, if you could share some of your knowledge about it.”\n\nQubing briefly described how the lady of Tushan had skillfully aided Emperor Yu, making up many poetical phrases as he went, his excellent narrative bubbling forth like a spring. The old man was overjoyed, telling his son, “Now we have the good fortune to hear what we’ve never heard before. This young gentleman is not just anyone, so please ask your mother to bring Qingfeng along and we can listen to him together, so they will also learn of our ancestors’ virtue.” Xiao’er slipped past the curtain that divided the room.\n\nSoon, the old woman reappeared with the young lady. Qubing looked her over carefully—her delicate form was exquisite, her bewitching eyes infused with intelligence—and nowhere was there a more beautiful creature. The old man pointed to his spouse and said, “This is my venerable wife.” Then pointing to the young woman, he added, “This is Qingfeng, who’s been like a niece to me. She’s quite kind, and whatever she hears or sees, she remembers and never forgets, so for that reason I’ve summoned her to listen.”\n\nQubing finished his oration and began drinking, turning first just to watch Qingfeng, then openly staring at her, transfixed. She felt his glance, and simply kept her head bowed. When Qubing covertly rested his foot upon her tiny slipper, she quickly pulled away her foot, but also didn’t appear upset. Qubing lost all discretion, and, unable to control himself, he rapped on the table, announcing, “If I could get a wife like this, I’d never exchange her, even to become a king!”\n\nThe old woman saw that as Qubing became more and more intoxicated, he also became more uninhibited, so she stood up with Qingfeng, hastily pulled aside the curtain, and left. Qubing, disappointed, took his leave of the old man and went out. His heart was so tightly bound, he couldn’t stop thinking about his passion for Qingfeng.\n\nWhen the next evening came, he returned, finding the place still fragrant with orchid and musk, so he waited there all night without moving, but amidst his loneliness, he didn’t so much as hear a cough.\n\nHe went back home and proposed a plan to his wife, expressing his desire to move their household to the Geng mansion, in hopes of achieving another meeting. His wife wouldn’t go along with it, so he went there by himself and did some reading on one of the mansion’s lower floors. When evening came, just as he was leaning over a desk, a ghost with streaming hair entered, its face black as lacquer, and stared at Qubing, wide-eyed. Qubing just laughed, dipping his fingers in some fresh ink and smearing it on himself, staring back in response with his eyes shining. The ghost, humiliated, vanished.\n\nThe next night, quite late, after extinguishing his candle to go to sleep, from the back of the house Qubing heard a bolt being withdrawn and a door opening. He quickly rose to take a look and found a door leaf open. Instantly, he heard the sound of a delicate tread, then candlelight began shining from inside the house.\n\nOn further inspection, he discovered it was Qingfeng. When she suddenly noticed Qubing, she was shocked and drew back, hastily closing the double-leaved door. Qubing knelt there for quite some time before speaking these words: “It was for you that I faced what was perilous—honestly, darling, that was the reason. We’re lucky no one else is around, and if you’d give me the pleaure of holding your hand, I could die without regret.”\n\nQingfeng said, “Don’t you think I know about your sincere, deeply-felt passion? But my uncle taught me a strict standard of family behavior that I dare not disobey.”\n\nQubing maintained his abject begging: “I don’t dare hope for the intimate feel of your flesh, but just to gaze into your eyes would be enough.” She agreed to permit this, opened the door and came out, whereupon he clutched her arms and drew her to him. Qubing was giddy with delight and they went downstairs together, where he took her in his arms and then sat her on his lap.\n\nShe said to him, “It was fate that brought us together; but once this night is over, there’s no use thinking we can stay together.”\n\n“Why not?” he asked.\n\nQingfeng explained, “My uncle is afraid of your unpredictability, so he changed into that vicious ghost to try to scare you away, but he didn’t even faze you. Now he’s already found another place for us to live, the family’s just moved all of our various possessions there, and I’ve been left to guard this place, but tomorrow I have to leave.” When she finished these words, she stood up to go, adding, “I’m afraid my uncle might return.”\n\nQubing stopped her, wanting to make love to her. They continued their debate until the old man unexpectedly walked in. Qingfeng, ashamed to face her uncle, lowered her head and leaned against the bed, tugging nervously at her sash without speaking. The old man angrily declared, “Your cheap behavior is a disgrace to my household! If you don’t leave here quickly, a flogging will help you along!” Hanging her head, Qingfeng ran out, then the old man also departed.\n\nTailing them and eavesdropping, Qubing caught a wide range of scolding and abuse. The sounds of Qingfeng’s plaintive sobbing cut him to the heart and in a loud voice he yelled, “Why are you treating Qingfeng this way when the fault is mine? If you’ll forgive her, punish the crime with sword or any other kind of blade and my body will willingly bear it!” Everything went silent for a very long while until Qubing returned and went to sleep. Subsequently, there were no more sounds—not so much as a breath—from inside the mansion.\n\nQubing’s uncle, hearing all about it and finding it bizarre, agreed to sell the place without dickering. Qubing, delighted, brought his household to the mansion and moved them in. They lived there quite comfortably for over a year, but Qubing never forgot about Qingfeng for even a moment.\n\nHe went to the family tomb on Pure Brightness Day, and while returning home, he spotted two little foxes being relentlessly pursued by hounds. One of them fled by dashing into the underbrush, but the other was so agitated that it continued running along the road. When it saw Qubing, it cried pitifully, cowering and ducking its head submissively, as though begging him for help. The scholar took pity on it, opened his coat, took it in his arms and carried it home.\n\nWhen he’d shut his door, he put it down on his bed—and it became Qingfeng. Beside himself with joy, he told her how sorry he was, and asked her how she’d been. She replied, “I was just out playing with a maidservant when we were confronted with that great misfortune. Without you, I’d surely have ended up in a dog’s stomach. I hope that even though I’m not like you, you won’t look on me with disgust.”\n\nQubing told her, “Every day I’m filled with thoughts of you, both in my conscious mind and in my dreams. Seeing you is like finding a rare gem, so how can you speak of disgust!”\n\n“Heaven has been acting in all of this,” she replied, “for if you hadn’t been revealed to me, how could we have been brought together? Fortunately, the maidservant must surely think me dead, so we can easily stay together forever as appointed.” The happy scholar lodged her in a part of the mansion separate from his family’s portion.\n\nMore than two years went by until Qubing was reading one night, and Xiao’er suddenly entered. The scholar stopped reading, surprised, and asked him why he’d come. Xiao’er prostrated himself on the ground, and with great gravity said, “My father has experienced a horrible disaster, and no one but you can save him. He was about to visit you himself to make his plea, but he was afraid you wouldn’t agree to it, which is why I’ve come.”\n\nHe asked, “So what’s the matter?”\n\n“Do you know the third son of Master Mo?” inquired Xiao’er.\n\nQubing answered, “That’s the son of one of my classmates.”\n\nXiao’er elaborated: “Tomorrow he’s going to come through here, and if he’s carrying a fox that he’s caught, I hope you’ll ask him to let you keep it.”\n\nQubing declared, “He made me feel ashamed in my own home, so I’ve given it a lot of thought and I don’t want to hear any more about his affairs. And as for your imploring—if you wish me to exercise my feeble efforts, I cannot unless Qingfeng comes to me!”\n\nThrough a shower of tears, Xiao’er cried, “Younger sister Feng died out in the wilds three years ago!”\n\nQubing shook his sleeve disdainfully and exclaimed, “Since that’s the case, my resentment is that much more!” He held up his book and loudly began to recite, careful not to look up from it. Xiao’er rose, sobbing until he lost his voice, then covered his face and left.\n\nQubing then went to Qingfeng’s quarters, to inform her of the incident. She went pale and inquired, “So are you going to rescue him or not?”\n\nHe said, “I’ll save him for sure; not consenting to it was just a way of paying him back for being harsh and unreasonable earlier.”\n\nQingfeng then happily remarked, “I was orphaned when quite young, and I depended on my uncle, who took care of me. Though he offended you in the past, it was to defend the family standards of behavior.”\n\n“Even so,” Qubing responded, “it’s hard for a person not to take that kind of thing to heart. If you were really dead, I certainly wouldn’t come to his aid.”\n\nLaughing, Qingfeng said, “Why are you so obstinate!”\n\nThe next day, Third Son Mo did arrive, bearing a bowcase engraved with tigers and followed by an impressive array of servants. Qubing met him at his gate. He noticed that Mo had shot quite a number of birds, and that in amongst them was a black fox, its pelt dark with blood; he ran his hand over it, the flesh underneath the fur still feeling warm. As he supported it with his hand, he commented that he had a worn fur coat and asked if he might have the pelt to sew on as a repair. With great deference, Mo untied it and offered it as a present.\n\nQubing immediately handed it over to Qingfeng, then offered his guest a drink. Once Mo had departed, Qingfeng hugged the fox to her chest, and in three days it revived, then expanded and metamorphosed into her uncle. When he raised his eyes, he saw Qingfeng, which made him think that he was no longer among the living. She narrated the details of what had happened to him. The old man then bowed to pay his respects to Qubing, expressing remorse for his former actions. Happy, he then turned to Qingfeng and said, “I always insisted you weren’t dead, and now here’s proof.”\n\nShe then told Qubing, “If you care for me, I ask that you will still allot us a portion of your mansion, to allow me to care in private for one who has cared for me.” Qubing promised he would do so. The old man, blushing, thanked him and took his leave.\n\nWhen evening came, he returned with his entire family. Thereafter, they were like blood relatives, father and son, no longer suspicious of each other. Qubing lived modestly in the house and passed the time with Xiao’er, sharing conversation over wine. The scholar’s wife bore him a son, who gradually grew up and accordingly was sent to Xiao’er to be tutored patiently on the right path, in order to imitate his teacher’s behavior.",

        "body": "In Taiyuan, a scholar named Wang was out walking one morning, when he met a young woman carrying a bundle of belongings by herself as though running away, and having a very difficult time with it as she went. Moving more briskly to catch up with her, he noticed she was about sixteen and quite beautiful. Enjoying the sight of her as his heart filled with love, he asked, “Why are you walking alone so early in the morning?”\n\nThe young woman replied, “A passerby can’t solve my unhappiness, so there’s no point bothering yourself to inquire.”\n\n“What’s making you so upset?” Wang asked. “If I can do anything in my power to help, I won’t say no.”\n\nDespondent, the young woman explained, “My parents, in their greediness, sold me as a concubine to a rich, influential family. The first wife was so jealous, all day long she insulted me and humiliated me with beatings, to the point that I couldn’t take it any longer, so I’m heading for someplace far away.”\n\n“Where to?” he asked.\n\n“An escapee,” she said, “alas, has no certain destination.”\n\nWang then declared, “My home isn’t far, and if it wouldn’t trouble you too much, you might join me there.” The young woman, delighted, agreed. Wang picked up her bundle of belongings and led her home.\n\nSeeing there was no one else in the room, the young woman inquired, “Sir, why isn’t your family here?”\n\n“This is just my study,” he explained.\n\nShe observed, “This place is really nice. If you pity me and want to save me, you must keep my presence here a close secret, and not let it out.” Wang promised not to tell. Then they slept together.\n\nHe set her up to hide in a secret room, and several days passed without anyone knowing she was there. Then Wang mentioned it privately to his wife, Chen. She suspected that the girl had been given as a concubine to some family, so she advised Wang to send her away. Wang wouldn’t hear of it.\n\nIn the market one day, Wang met a Daoist priest who turned to stare at him in amazement, and asked, “What have you gotten yourself into?”\n\n“Nothing,” Wang replied.\n\nThe Daoist declared, “There’s an evil presence wound around you—how can you say it’s nothing?” Wang reasserted his innocence.\n\nThe Daoist then left, muttering, “Idiot! Some people just refuse to recognize when death is coming after them.” Wang thought his words strange, and entertained brief doubts about the young woman; then he considered that since she was obviously such a beauty, she couldn’t possibly be an evil spirit, meaning that the priest must have been hoping to offer his prayers for averting evil in exchange for the price of a meal.\n\nNot much later, arriving at the door of his study, he found it barred from the inside, so he couldn’t get in. This made him think that something was going on inside, so he clambered over a ruined wall. The door to the inner room was also barred, so he crept quietly to a window and peered inside, spotting a hideous demon, its face bluish-green, its teeth as jagged as a saw’s. It spread a human skin out on the bed, holding a brush, and began to paint on it; when it was done, it tossed the brush aside, held up the skin, and shook it out like it was a cloak, then wrapped it around its body, immediately transforming it into the young woman.\n\nWhen he saw it take her shape, Wang, terrified, scurried away like a wild animal. He anxiously sought out the Daoist, but didn’t know where to find him. Looking all over for traces, he finally found him outside the city, and went down on his knees to beg for rescue. The priest said, “Let me drive it away for you. This thing must be suffering pretty significantly, and just found a way to rest itself—so for that reason, I couldn’t be hard-hearted enough to take its life.”\n\nThen he gave Wang a fly swatter, ordering him to hang it above the door of his bedroom. As Wang was about to leave, the Daoist arranged for them to meet at the Qingdi Temple. Wang left, but didn’t dare enter his study, so he slept in the inner room and hung the swatter above the door there.\n\nAbout the time of the first watch, he heard something rubbing at his door, but he wouldn’t venture to sneak a look for himself, so he sent his wife to take a peek. She simply saw the young woman draw near, stare at the swatter, and then come no closer; she stood there grinding her teeth for a very long time, then left. A short time later she returned, growling, “The Daoist hopes to scare me off. But I can’t spit out what I haven’t yet put in my mouth!” She grabbed the swatter and broke it into pieces, wrecked the bedroom door, and in she rushed.\n\nLeaping directly onto Wang’s bed, she ripped open his chest, took his heart in both hands, and fled. His wife screamed. A maid servant rushed in with a candle, but Wang was already dead, his chest cavity a bloody ruins. Chen, horrified, wept, but dared not make a sound.\n\nThe next day, she sent her husband’s younger brother to inform the Daoist. The priest, furious, fumed, “I originally took pity on this demon, then it dares to do this.” He left immediately, following Wang’s brother home. The young woman was already gone, but the priest raised his head to look in all four directions, and said, “We’re lucky—she hasn’t gotten very far!” Then he asked, “Whose home is that in the southern courtyard?”\n\nThe young brother replied, “That’s my place.”\n\n“That’s where she is right now,” said the Daoist. Wang’s brother was dumbfounded, and didn’t think it even possible. The Daoist then asked, “Haven’t you recently had a stranger show up there?”\n\nThe brother answered, “Early this morning I left for Qingdi Temple, so I don’t know. Let me go and find out.” He went out and shortly returned, reporting, “Someone’s there, alright. This morning an old woman showed up, hoping to be hired as a household servant, and my wife hired her, so she’s still there.”\n\nThe Daoist said, “That’s the monster.” Consequently, he went there with the younger brother. Brandishing a wooden sword, he stood in the middle of the courtyard, shouting, “Accursed demon! You owe me for my swatter!”\n\nThe old woman froze in the house, pale with fright, then ran out the gate, hoping to escape. The priest thereupon struck her. The old woman fell, her human skin peeling up and flaking off, changing her back into a horrible demon that lay on the ground, squealing like a pig. With his wooden sword, the Daoist beheaded the abomination; its body turned into a dense smoke, spread over the ground, and then collected into a single pile.\n\nWhen the priest took out a bottle gourd, pulled out the stopper, and placed it in the smoke, there was a sucking sound, like someone drawing in a breath, until in the blink of an eye, the smoke was sucked into the gourd. The Daoist replaced the stopper and put the gourd back in his bag.\n\nTogether they looked at the human skin with eyebrows, eyes, hands, and feet painted on, all ready to be worn. The Daoist rolled it up, with the sound someone would make rolling up a scroll painting, also put it in his bag, then took his leave of the others and went on his way. Chen knelt respectfully to him at the gate, weeping and begging him for a way to bring Wang back to life. The priest explained that he lacked the ability to do so. Chen increased her pitiful pleading, throwing herself on the ground and refusing to get up.\n\nThe Daoist then pondered carefully and said, “My magic is superficial, so I really can’t raise the dead. But I can point out a man who probably can do it, so if you go and make your request of him, he’ll surely try to help you out.”\n\nShe asked, “What man?”\n\nThe priest replied, “In the marketplace, there’s a mad beggar, who’s always resting on dungheaps. Try kowtowing, and then make your plea to him. If the madman insults you or your husband, don’t give way to anger.” Wang’s younger brother had heard of the man. He and his sister-in-law bid farewell to the Daoist and headed off together.\n\nThey found the beggar singing agitatedly beside the road, long strands of snot hanging from his nose, stinking so foully that it was almost impossible to force oneself near him. Chen crawled before him on her knees.\n\nThe beggar, laughing, cried, “Is this beauty here because she loves me?” Chen then informed him why she’d come. Again he laughed, and said, “There are plenty of men who can be your husband out there, so why do you want this one alive?” Chen remained steadfast in her pleading. Then he exclaimed, “How strange! A man dies and she comes to beg his life from me. What am I, Yama, the Hell King?”\n\nFurious, he struck Chen with his stick. Chen endured the pain patiently. Bystanders began gathering like a wall around them. The beggar coughed up phlegm, spit a large glob of it into his hand, then raised it in the direction of Chen’s lips, demanding, “Eat it!” Chen turned red in the face, refusing to do it; but once she recalled the Daoist’s advice, she successfully choked it down. She felt it enter her throat like a wad of cotton being forced there, extremely resistant to going down, until it finally stopped to form a knot in her chest.\n\nThe beggar roared in laughter, exclaiming, “The beauty really loves me!” He then stood up and walked off, without even glancing at her. She pursued him until he entered a temple. Chasing after him to beg his assistance, she couldn’t tell where he’d gone; she hunted everywhere yet there was no sign of him, so she left, ashamed and angry. Already mourning her husband’s death, now she also regretted having eaten the phlegm, and felt humiliated, hanging her head as others watched her crying pitifully, just wanting to die.\n\nThen she decided to lay out her husband’s corpse and drain the blood from it, while household members stood by, looking on, without daring to approach. Chen held the corpse in her arms, and placed the intestines back in it, sobbing all the while.\n\nJust when she had gone hoarse from the wretched extremes of her crying, she suddenly felt the urge to vomit. She became aware of that knotted thing in her chest suddenly forcing its way out, and before she could turn her head, it dropped into Wang’s chest cavity. She was stunned, for it was a human heart. There it sat in the cavity, rhythmically beating, warm vapors rising off it like mist. It was astonishing.\n\nAnxiously, with both hands, she closed the cavity, using all her strength to squeeze it shut as she held him in her arms. If she relaxed even a little, a dense cloud of vapors would seep through the edges of the wound. Thus she tore up some silk and wrapped it tightly around Wang. With her hands, she warmed his body, which gradually began responding. She covered him then with a large quilt. In the night, when she looked under it, she found faint breath coming from his nostrils.\n\nBy daybreak, Wang was whole and alive. He told her, “It was oddly like a dream, but I could feel some mysterious pain in my chest.” When she examined the place where he’d been torn open, she found a scab had formed there the size of a coin—and soon he recovered.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “How foolish some people are! What are obviously demons they take for beauties. How deluded such fools are! What is obviously devotion, they treat with disregard. When men are lured by the appearances of love, their wives are obliged to eat what others have spit out. The way of heaven is to repay love, yet the foolish and deluded are oblivious to this. What a pity that there are such men!”",

        "body": "In Chu, there was a certain old man who was off engaged in foreign trade. His wife, who’d been left alone in the house, dreamed that someone was there with her; when she woke up and reached out her hand, she found a little man there. Scrutinizing him, she thought him an odd creature, before she realized that it was a fox. A moment later it ran under the bed and vanished, though the door to the room hadn’t been opened.\n\nWhen the next night came, she asked the old woman who was her cook to sleep there and keep her company. The wife had a ten-year-old son who ordinarily slept in his own bed, and he was also invited to join them. Late that night, as the old woman and the son slept, the fox returned. The wife began murmuring, like she was speaking in her dreams. This woke the cook, who cried out to her, and the fox ran away. From then on, the wife felt agitated, as though she needed to escape from something.\n\nWhen the evening arrived, she didn’t dare blow out the candle, and warned her son not to sleep too deeply. As the night progressed, the son and the old woman leaned against the wall to catch a few winks of sleep. Then when they woke up, the wife was gone, so they figured she must have stepped out to relieve herself; they waited a long time, but she didn’t return, so they began to worry. The old woman was frightened, and didn’t dare go out to look for her.\n\nThe son grabbed a burning candle and looked everywhere in the house, till in one room he found his mother lying naked; he drew near to offer her assistance, and she didn’t seem to feel at all bashful or self-conscious. She became progressively more aberrant, singing, sobbing, shouting and cursing each day, in many different ways.\n\nAt night, she’d become disgusted at the idea of other people being in the room, so the son slept in a separate bed and the old woman was also kept out. The son always listened till he heard his mother’s caustic voice, then he’d get up with a light to investigate. The mother would angrily scold her son, but he didn’t let it get to him, and everyone admired his courage.\n\nHowever, he also indulged himself in playing, pretending each day he was a block layer, piling up tiles and blocks against a window, ignoring calls for him to stop. When someone removed one of the blocks, he rolled around on the ground in a crying tantrum, so no one ventured to provoke him further by touching them. After several days, two windows had been completely covered up, so no light could shine through. When this was done, he smeared on mud to close up any gaps in the wall, applying it all day long without complaining about the labor.\n\nOnce he was finished spreading it on, he had nothing to do, so he grabbed a kitchen knife and quickly began sharpening it. Observing this, everyone became disgusted with his foolishness and refused to pay any further attention to him.\n\nThat night, the son concealed the knife in his clothing, and with a large dipper covered his lamp. He waited until his mother began to rave in her sleep, then swiftly uncovered the lamp, shut the door, and began shouting. Time passed without anything odd happening, so he feigned moving away from the door, pretending that he wanted to leave the room and relieve himself outside.\n\nSuddenly, something like a fox appeared, abruptly seizing the opportunity to run for the door. The son struck quickly, neatly cutting off two inches of its tail though it got away. Blood dripped from the segment like water. Subsequently, when he carried his lamp over and lifted it up, his mother as usual began cursing him, but the son just acted as though he hadn’t heard her. He hadn’t hit the thing where it mattered, and, profoundly disappointed about it, he went to rest. Thinking it over to himself, he realized that even if he hadn’t killed it, at least he’d been able to stop it from getting back in.\n\nAt daybreak, he noticed that there were traces of blood beyond his wall, so he followed them. The blood led him into a garden belonging to the He family. When night arrived and it became clear that the thing hadn’t come back, the son was privately overjoyed. Nevertheless, his mother inexplicably remained still, lying there like she was dead.\n\nNot long afterwards, the merchant returned home, rushed to his wife’s bed, and asked what had happened. The wife began insulting him, treating him like an enemy. The son then gave his account. The old man, horrified, sent for medicine for her. The wife, however, poured out the medicine, while berating and swearing at them. Secretly, they put the medicine into her soup and assorted beverages, so over the course of several days, she gradually settled down. The father and son were extremely pleased.\n\nOne night they were sleeping when the old man woke up to find his wife missing; father and son went looking for her, and discovered her in another room. Henceforward. she was continually agitated, and the old man found her unwilling to be in the same room with him. As the evenings arrived, she inevitably fled from her room. When he tried to hold her back, she heaped even more abuse on him.\n\nThe old man had no plan to offer, and hence he locked her in the room. But whenever his wife rushed to make her escape, the door opened all by itself. In his suffering, the old man tried to expel the evil with prayers aimed at driving it out, but nothing seemed to have any effect.\n\nAt dusk, the son stealthily entered the He family garden and laid down in the bushes, to see if he could determine the fox’s whereabouts. As the moon began to rise, he suddenly heard someone speaking. Quietly pushing aside a gnarled branch, he saw two persons having a drink while a servant with a very long beard poured a jug for them, wearing an old, brown-colored garment. Their words were muttered softly and confidentially, so he wasn’t able to make out what they were saying.\n\nAfter awhile, he heard one of the people say, “Tomorrow you can bring some wine here.” An instant later, they were gone, and only the long-bearded servant remained behind, taking off his garment and lying down upon the stones of the courtyard. Carefully examining him, the son noticed that while his four limbs were human, he had a tail hanging down behind him.\n\nThe son wanted to rush home, but was afraid the fox might become aware of his presence, so he stayed there until the night passed. Just before daybreak, he heard the two men return again, one after the other, murmuring before they all three entered a bamboo grove. The son then ran home.\n\nThe old man asked him where he’d gone and he answered, “I slept at uncle’s house.” Then he followed his father into the marketplace, where he spotted a hat with a fox tail hanging garishly from it, and begged the old man to buy it for him. The old man wouldn’t turn around. The son tugged at his father’s clothing, noisily acting spoiled. The old man couldn’t put up with this—and hence to stop his shenanigans, he bought it for him.\n\nWhile the father carried on an amicable trade in one of the shops, the son played beside him, and then took advantage while he was turned away to grab some of his money and buy some wine, which he left on deposit with the owner of the wine shop.\n\nHe had an uncle from his mother’s side of the family who owned a house in the city, and whose business was hunting. The son ran off to his house. His uncle, however, had stepped out. His aunt inquired about his mother’s infirmity, to which he replied, “Each successive day she’s a little better. However, some rat has been chewing at her wardrobe, and she’s so angry that it’s brought her to tears that she can’t get rid of it, so that’s why she sent me to ask for some poison.”\n\nThe aunt picked up a box, took out a lump of the compound the size of a coin, wrapped it up, and gave it to the boy. The son felt there was too little. The aunt wanted him to have a seat while she went to prepare some soup and pancakes. The son scanned the room to make sure no one was around, before he took out the box of poison, stealthily scooped up two handfuls of it, and stowed it away. Then he hurried to tell his aunt not to trouble herself cooking for him, since “Father’s waiting for me in the marketplace, so I don’t have the leisure to stay and eat.”\n\nHe then retraced his steps and secretly slipped the poison into the wine. He wandered about the marketplace until dark, and then returned home. His father asked him where he’d been, and he reported that he’d been at his uncle’s house. For days, the son repeated this habit of wandering between shops.\n\nOne day, he spotted the long-bearded man mingling in the crowd. The son scrupulously verified it was the same man, then covertly stayed close to him. Eventually, he actually spoke to him, asking him where he lived.\n\nThe man answered, “North of the village.”\n\nHe inquired the same of the boy, who lied, “In a burrow.”\n\nThe long-bearded fellow allowed as how it was strange that he lived in a hole for his home. The son, laughing, exclaimed, “That burrow’s been our home for generations—and yours as well, right?”\n\nThe man was alarmed by this, and flatly demanded to know his name. The boy replied, “I’m a son of the Hu family. Some time ago, I stopped at the He family’s garden, and there I saw you serving two gentlemen, so how could I forget you?”\n\nThe man then carefully examined him, half believing and half doubting him. The boy proceeded to open his robe ever so minutely, little by little, until he revealed his purchased tail, and said, “We folk can pass ourselves off as humans except for our tails, which bring us unlimited resentment.”\n\nThe man asked him, “So why’d you want to come to the marketplace?”\n\n“Father sent me to buy wine,” the son explained. The man told him that he, too, had come to buy wine. “So have you bought any or not?” asked the boy.\n\n“We folk are quite poor,” the man answered, “hence I usually steal it when I get the opportunity.”\n\nThe son noted, “That kind of venture’s very hazardous, a risky exercise.”\n\n“I received my masters’ orders,” the man declared, “so I can’t disobey them.”\n\n“Just who are your masters?” the son asked him.\n\nThe man explained, “What you saw were two brothers. The one’s been having intimate relations north of the village with a lady named Wang, the other’s been lodging east of the village with a certain old man’s family. The old man’s son is very cruel, and actually cut off enough of his tail that it took ten days to heal, but now he’s back at it like before.” When he finished speaking, he wanted to leave, explaining, “I don’t want to expose my intentions.”\n\nThe son declared, “Stealing it’s hard, but buying it’s easy. I bought some earlier that I stored in the wine shop, and I’d respectfully like to offer it to you as a present. My bag still has some money in it, so it’s no problem for me to buy more.”\n\nThe long-bearded man was so embarrassed, he didn’t know how he could repay the boy. The son reassured him, “We’re the same kind of folk, so why be stingy about such a little thing? When I get some time, I’ll come accept a hearty drink from you.” So they went to the shop together, the son picked up the wine and gave it to the man, then he went home.\n\nWhen night came, his mother eventually fell into a peaceful sleep and didn’t try to run off. The son knew in his heart that something was up, so he told his father; they went to take a closer look, and found two dead foxes outside the garden house, one of them dead on the grass, blood still streaming from its mouth. The wine jar remained there, so they picked it up and shook it, determining it wasn’t yet all gone.\n\nThe father, shocked, demanded, “Why wasn’t I informed about this earlier?”\n\nHis son replied, “This thing was extremely clever—once I’d told you, it would have known everything.”\n\nDelighted, the old man said, “My son, to defeat a fox makes you another Chen Ping.” Thereupon, father and son slung the foxes over their shoulders and went home. They saw that one fox had a blunted tail, just as if it’d been scarred by a knife.\n\nFrom that time on, all was tranquil again. But the wife remained very, very thin, and though her mind gradually became coherent, she nevertheless developed a persistent cough, constantly having to get up to vomit or to spit while still trying to get well.\n\nNorth of the village, the woman named Wang had also been afflicted by a fox; it was said of her that when the foxes were killed, she also began to recover from her illness.\n\nBecause of all this, the old man thought his son most rare, so he taught him to ride and to shoot. Later on, he became a distinguished general in the army.",

        "title": "Scholar Dong",
        "body": "Scholar Dong, whose style name was Xiasi, lived in the westernmost portion of Qingzhou. Around sunset on a particular winter’s day, he spread a quilt over his bed and stirred the coals in his room. He was just about to put a cover over his lamp when a friend invited him over for drinks, so he locked his door and went out.\n\nOver at his friend’s house sat a doctor who was very knowledgeable about the fundamentals of reading the pulse, and was busily examining all of the guests. At last he turned to Wang Jiusi and Dong to say, “I’ve read a great many pulses, but none so strange as yours, gentlemen: one with the pulse of the wealthy, but containing signs of pending bankruptcy, and one with the pulse of the long-lived, but with the possibility of sudden death. This anomaly exceeds my humble knowledge. Certainly, Master Dong, yours is particularly unusual.”\n\nAlarmed, everyone asked him to elaborate. He replied, “That’s the limit of my medical skills, I couldn’t venture any other opinions with certainty. I hope you two gentlemen will be very careful.” Upon hearing this, the two men were quite startled, but since the doctor’s diagnoses were so contradictory, they didn’t put much faith in them.\n\nAt midnight, Dong went home, where he noticed his door was half open, and became extremely suspicious. Trying to recall in his drunken state, he decided that he must have been in such a hurry to leave home that he’d forgotten to lock it. He went inside and before hurrying to light a fire, first stuck his hand under the quilt to find out if it was still warm or not. Upon doing so, he felt the smooth flesh of someone lying there. Greatly stunned, he drew back his hand.\n\nHe quickly lit a fire and to his surprise found a beautiful girl there, with a child’s flawless complexion, looking like one of the celestials. He was deliriously happy. He figured he’d have some naughty fun, and explored the lower part of her body further, only to find a long, fuzzy tail there. Terribly frightened, he started to run away.\n\nThe girl woke up just then, put out her hand, and grabbed Dong’s arm, saying, “Where are you going?”\n\nDong, who became even more frightened, pitifully begged, “I hope you’ll pardon me, beautiful fairy!”\n\nThe girl, laughing, asked, “What have you seen here, to be afraid of me?”\n\nDong answered, “I don’t fear your hand—it’s your tail that scares me.”\n\nThe girl laughed again and said, “You’re mistaken. What tail would that be?” Guiding Dong’s hand, she forced him to explore with it, and he felt the smooth flesh of her leg and rump. Laughing, she asked, “What do you think now? You’re so ridiculously drunk, you can’t even see straight, yet you’re accusing me falsely of whatever it is.”\n\nDong remained excited that she was so beautiful, and was even more attracted to her, so he began to berate himself for having been wrong before. Yet he still had doubts about the reasons for her showing up. The girl explained, “Don’t you remember your neighbor to the east, the small girl with the light-colored hair? As I count on my fingers, it’s been ten years since we moved away. Back then, I wasn’t yet fifteen, and you were also just a youngster.”\n\nDong suddenly realized who she was, and said, “So you’re the Zhou daughter, A-Suo?”\n\n“That’s me,” the girl answered.\n\nDong declared, “Your talking about it helped me to remember. I haven’t seen you for ten years, and now, slim and lovely, here you are! But why have you suddenly come back?”\n\nThe girl explained, “I was married to a foolish man for four or five years, then my parents-in-law both died, and it was my further misfortune to become a widow after that. I became the last surviving member of the family, all alone with no one to depend upon. In recalling my childhood, the only person I could remember was you, so for that reason I came here to see you. I entered your gate at sunset, but you’d been invited out for drinks and were just leaving, so I secretly hid and waited for you to return. Since I was waiting for a long time, my feet felt icy and my skin had goosebumps, thus I borrowed your quilt to warm myself; please don’t greet me with suspicion.”\n\nDong was hoping to hear this, so he undressed and they slept together, with the scholar feeling very satisfied about it all. Carrying on like this for over a month, he began to lose weight, and when his family members asked him about it, he always told them he didn’t know why it was happening.\n\nOver a period of time, he became increasingly emaciated, until, in dread, he went to see the man who was skilled at reading pulses again. The man informed him, “This pulse is bewitched. Now the death prediction I gave you that day a while back has been proven by this illness.” Dong broke into tears and wouldn’t leave. Since the doctor couldn’t avoid his pleas, he applied acupuncture and moxibustion, and offered him some medicine as a present. He also advised Dong, “If you meet any women, force yourself to avoid becoming intimate with them.” Dong recognized how dangerous his situation had become.\n\nHe went home and the girl, giggling, wanted him to make love to her. Dong grew angry and exploded, “We’re not going to be doing anything together any more, because I’m going to die!” He stormed out without turning back to look at her.\n\nThe girl felt terribly humiliated, and with equal fury, exclaimed, “So, you still want to live!”\n\nWhen evening arrived, Dong took his medicine, went to bed by himself, and had just shut his eyes when he began dreaming of making love to the girl. He woke up suddenly, and found the bedclothes wet with his ejaculation. More fearful than ever, he moved and went to sleep in the central portion of the house, while his wife made a fire and stood by to defend him.\n\nDong went on having such dreams. Whenever he woke up to see the woman, she just disappeared. After several days, Dong vomited blood, fighting against it as long as he could, and then died.\n\nWang Jiusi was in his study when he saw a young lady walk in, and overwhelmed by her beauty, he made love to her. When he asked about her background, she replied, “I was involved with your neighbor. I was faithful to him as his lover, never suspecting that he’d get involved with some fox and die. That kind of evil spirit can easily be angered—scholars in particular should be cautious and guard against them.” Wang adored her even more for this, so they became lovers.\n\nOnce this had gone on for quite some time, his mind began to wander, he became ill and emaciated, and he had a dream in which Dong said to him, “You’ve gotten involved with a fox. She killed me and now she wants to kill my friend. I’ve made a complaint against her in the underworld in order to achieve revenge. On the seventh day of the month, you must burn incense outside your room—don’t forget to do it!” Wang woke up, thinking this odd.\n\nHe called out to the girl, “I’m very sick and I’m afraid I’m about to fall into the great abyss, so I’ve been persuaded not to get close to any women.”\n\nThe girl answered, “Those who are destined to have long lives can still live a long time even when they’re involved with women; those who are doomed to die at a young age will die all the same, even if they avoid women.” She sat there making fun of him and laughing. Wang was unable to concentrate on holding out, so again he had sex with her. When they were finished he regretted it, but he just couldn’t stop himself.\n\nThat evening, he inserted a stick of incense above his door. The girl showed up, pulled it out, and threw it away. In the night, he dreamt once again that Dong had come to him to admonish Wang for having ignored his advice.\n\nOnce it was dark the next night, he enjoined his family members to delay going to bed until after they’d secretly burned some incense for him. The girl crawled onto his bed and, suddenly frightened, demanded, “Has someone put out more of that incense again?” Wang said he didn’t know.\n\nThe girl got up and found the incense, once again broke it in two and extinguished it. She reentered and asked, “Who told you to do that?”\n\nWang replied, “It was probably one of my household members, concerned about my illness, who took the advice of some exorcist and has been offering prayers to avert evil.” The girl became unsettled and dour. When his family members stealthily spied that the incense had been snuffed out, they started some more burning.\n\nThe girl suddenly sighed and exclaimed, “You’re a lucky one, alright. It was a mistake for me to harm Xiasi, and then come running to you—that was definitely excessive. I’m about to have it out with him in the underworld. If you can still think fondly about the love between us, don’t let anything happen to my remains.” She withdrew from the bed to make her journey below, then fell to the ground and died.\n\nHe lit a candle and found a fox lying there. Still fearing for his life, he shouted for his family members to skin it, and to hang its hide up. Wang remained very sick till he saw the fox return and say to him, “I made my appeal to the underworld judges. They ruled that Dong had been aroused by lust, so death is what his guilt deserves. As far as my own blame in the matter, they said I shouldn’t beguile people, and demanded that I forfeit my pill of immortality, then ordered me to return among the living. So where’d you put my remains?”\n\nHe told her, “My family members didn’t know any better, so they skinned it.”\n\nThe fox, mortified, cried out, “I’ve killed so many people, my death now is hardly premature; but for it to come suddenly at your hands—!” Filled with hate and resentment, she went away. Wang was so sick that he nearly died, though he recovered in about half a year.",

        "body": "There was a scholar in the city of Xin, Wang Qihou, whose courtesy name was Zhongyu, the grandson of provincial governor Wang Xiangkun. One day he saw a woman, plump and dark-looking, enter his room. Laughing, she drew near and sat on his bed, her intentions clearly indecent. Wang resisted her, but she wouldn’t leave.\n\nThereafter, whether Wang was sitting or was lying down, she was always in his sight. However, he was so determinedly stoic that the woman couldn’t seduce him. She became angry with him and slapped his cheek loudly, but his face betrayed no sign of it having been at all painful.\n\nThe woman then tied a belt to an overhead beam, and grabbed him, to hang the two of them together. Wang unconsciously flung himself under the beam, and craned his neck so she could hang him. Anyone could see that his feet weren’t on the ground, suspended there in the air, though it was also the case that he seemed unable to die this way.\n\nOthers considered him to have gone mad.\n\nSuddenly he cried, “She’s going to take and throw me in the river.” Staring into the distance toward the river, he wildly rushed off towards it until someone tugged at him to stop. It was like this in all matters: daily, again and again, medical skills and medicine had no effect.\n\nOne day, unexpectedly, he watched as a warrior knight bound her in chains and then came forward, furiously shouting, “How dare you trouble such an honest and sincere man like that!” Having made a prisoner of the woman, he dragged her out through a window.\n\nOnce the knight took her outside, the woman no longer appeared like a normal person, for her eyes flashed with lightning while her mouth, bright red with blood, gaped as large as a basin. Wang remembered that on the gate of the temple of the city god, there were four clay demons that had been broken off—looking just like the one in front of him. Thereupon he recovered from his madness."

        "body": "In Lingyang, there lived a scholar by the name of Zhu Erdan, whose style name was Xiaoming. His personality was vigorous and unrestrained. However, he was basically rather stupid, and though he sincerely studied hard, he still wasn’t very widely known.\n\nOne day, a crowd of scholar’s society members were drinking. Undoubtedly to make fun of him, one of the members said, “You have a reputation for being heroic, so if you dare to go to the Temple of the Ten Kings in the middle of the night and bring back here the fierce-looking afterlife official from the gallery on the left, the group of us will pool our money and treat you to a feast.”\n\nThis Temple of the Ten Kings, built at Lingyang, featured gods and demons carved entirely from wood, decorated so convincingly that it seemed as though they were alive. Standing in the eastern corridor, there was a _panguan_ with a green face and red beard, whose looks were especially ferocious and horrible. Sometimes in the night, one could hear the sounds of torture and interrogation in the corridors. Entering them caused the hair on one’s head immediately to stand on end. With this in mind, the group of scholars meant to challenge Zhu.\n\nZhu smiled, got up, and left directly to go there. In no time, a great cry came from outside the gate: “At my invitation, here he is—the venerable bearded master!” The waiting scholars all rose to their feet.\n\nSuddenly Zhu burst in, carrying the carved _panguan_ on his back, put him down on the table, served him a cup of wine, and respectfully poured out three libations. The scholars watched him, shrinking back in fear that they weren’t safe, and remained standing, having upset their seats. They begged him to take the official back.\n\nZhu poured another cup of wine on the ground, praying, “Though my rash actions were ignorant, your honor, I hope you’ll forgive them rather than hold them against me. My modest home is not far from here, and if it pleases you to come and share some drinks there, I hope you’ll let nothing stand between us.” Then he picked up the carving and carried it back.\n\nThe next day, the scholars really did invite him out for drinks. By the time dusk arrived, Zhu was half drunk and went home, but figured he wasn’t finished yet, so he grabbed a lamp and poured himself some more wine. Suddenly someone entered through the dividing curtain, and when Zhu looked closely, he could tell it was the _panguan_ himself.\n\nZhu stood up and exclaimed, “I imagine this means that I’m about to die! Last night I brazenly showed disrespect for you—so have you arrived now to chop off my head?”\n\nWith a small chuckle, the official spoke through his thick beard: “Not at all. Yesterday your bit of high-jinx was concluded between us justly with your offer, and since this evening I’m unexpectedly at leisure, I’ve come to honor your invitation.”\n\nZhu was greatly pleased and tugged at the _panguan_’s robe, urging him to sit, while he got up to wash some cups and light a fire. The official suggested, “The weather’s warm and mild, so let’s drink the wine cold.” Zhu followed his suggestion, setting a wine jar on the table, then rushed off to tell his servants to prepare a variety of dishes.\n\nWhen his wife heard about the _panguan_’s arrival, she was astonished, and warned Zhu not to go back. But Zhu, refusing to listen, stood waiting while supervising the dishes’ preparation, then left with them.\n\nAfter they had amiably toasted each other with cups of wine, Zhu asked the _panguan_ his name. He replied, “My family name is Lu, but I don’t have a first name.” They spoke about the classics, the official responding instantly to Zhu’s questions.\n\n“Can you compose in the style of the imperial examinations?” Zhu inquired.\n\nOfficial Lu responded, “I can distinguish what is elegant from what is terrible. The compositions that we underworld officials have to recite are pretty similar to what’s produced in the world of the living.”\n\nOfficial Lu proved to be a prodigious drinker, draining ten cups in a single round. Since Zhu had been drinking all day long, he soon passed out with an elegant gesture, falling onto the table into a drunken sleep. When he woke up, the last of the burning candles was sputtering a dim yellow, and his ghostly guest was gone.\n\nAfter that, _panguan_ Lu always put in an appearance every two or three days, so their camaraderie increased to the point that the official at times would even sleep there. Whenever Zhu showed him his essays, Lu would always mark them in red, with words to the effect that they weren’t so good.\n\nOne night, Zhu became drunk and went on to bed while Lu continued drinking. Suddenly, in the midst of a drunken dream, he became aware of a slight pain in his guts; when he woke up and looked around, he saw Lu sitting up on the bed next to him, pulling Zhu’s intestines and stomach out of a gaping cavity, and then carefully rearranging them. Stunned, he cried, “There’s been no hate or resentment between us, so why are you trying to kill me?”\n\nLu laughed and said, “Have no fear, I’m just exchanging your heart for a wiser one.” He then unhurriedly replaced the intestines and closed him up, wrapping him around the waist with the kind of bandages used for binding women’s feet. When his objective had been accomplished, there were no traces of blood on the bed. Zhu’s belly simply felt a little numb.\n\nHe saw Lu put a piece of flesh on the table. When Zhu asked him what it was, he explained, “This is your heart. Since it wasn’t very adept at writing compositions, I knew that the channels of writing ability in your heart had become blocked. Just now, in the underworld, from out of ten million hearts I chose a superb one for you, inserted it in place of yours, and will keep yours to make up for the one that’s missing.” Then he stood up, shut the door behind him, and left.\n\nAt first light, Zhu loosened the bandage to take a look, and found the wound had sealed itself, leaving a bright red line of scar to mark it. From thence forward, his writing improved tremendously, and he remembered everything he read.\n\nAfter several days, he brought another essay to the official. Lu said, “Now you can do it. Unfortunately, your luck’s a bit shaky, so you won’t be able to achieve great success, though you’ll succeed at the local and provincial examinations.”\n\nZhu asked, “When will that happen?”\n\n“This year you’ll certainly be the best,” Lu replied.\n\nNot surprisingly, Zhu finished at the top of his cohort in the local examinations, and when the results of the provincial examinations were posted that fall, Zhu also finished in first place. The same group of scholars who had always played tricks on him happened by; upon spotting the compositions of the successful candidates, they gawked in disbelief and inquired into the details until they learned what strange things had happened.\n\nTogether they begged Zhu at his earliest convenience to set up a meeting for them with _panguan_ Lu. Lu agreed to the meeting. The scholars made big plans for receiving him. During the first watch, Lu arrived with his red beard waving and his eyes flashing like lightning. All color drained from the scholars and their teeth began chattering; one after another, they all ran off.\n\nZhu then took Lu home with him for some drinks and once they were intoxicated, Zhu remarked, “You’ve washed my intestines and rearranged my stomach, so I’ve already received many favors from you. Still, there’s one piece of business that I’d like to trouble you with, but I don’t know—may I?”\n\nLu plainly invited him to make his request.\n\nZhu replied, “Since you can change a person’s heart, I suppose you can also change a person’s looks. My wife, whom I married when we turned adults, has a body you can’t help but like, but from the neck up she’s just pretty ugly. So I’d like to trouble you to use your blade again—how about it?”\n\nLu laughed and said, “Very well, but permit me some time to carry it out.”\n\nAfter several days, Lu arrived at midnight and knocked at the door. Zhu anxiously got up and invited him in. Lighting a candle, he could see that there was something wrapped up under Lu’s robe. When he asked about it, Lu answered, “Not long ago you urged something of me, and a most difficult matter it was. But I’ve just obtained a beautiful woman’s head, which I’m offering to you as you requested.”\n\nZhu poked at the bundle, and upon inspection found the neck still wet with blood. Lu urged him to go inside quickly, without rousing the poultry and dogs. Zhu was worried that the door to the sleeping quarters might have been bolted for the night. When Lu pushed at it with one hand, the door opened up all by itself.\n\nZhu led him to his wife’s bedroom, where they saw her lying on her side, asleep. Lu gave the head to Zhu to hold, then from his boot he took a blade sharp enough to cut off a head, and pressed it at the nape of the wife’s neck, as though he was cutting beancurd—the blade easily sliced and severed, till the head rolled off the side of the pillow; Lu urgently grabbed the beauty’s head that Zhu had been clutching to his chest and fitted it to the wife’s neck, thoroughly checking that it was lined up straight, then pressed it into place. With that concluded, Lu propped her shoulders up with the pillow, directed Zhu to bury his wife’s head in a peaceful spot, and then left.\n\nZhu’s wife woke up, her neck feeling rather numb and her face rather strange; when she rubbed it, some dried blood flaked off, which really shook her up. She called to her maid to bring in a basin of water for washing; the maid saw the bloody mess on her mistress’ face and was utterly terrified. The wife washed it off, the water in the basin turning completely red. When she raised her face, the maid was utterly astonished once again to see that it was entirely unfamiliar to her.\n\nThe wife examined herself in the mirror, stunned by the image and unable to explain it. Zhu came in and told her what had happened; when he looked her over, he noticed long eyebrows with ends disappearing under the bangs of her hair, and dimples that formed in her cheeks when she smiled, just like a beauty from some painting. He loosened her robe to get a better look and found a red line circling her neck, with flesh above and below it that was certainly of two different shades.\n\nBefore all this took place, there was an official named Wu, who had a beautiful daughter who’d never married, having lost two prospective husbands to death, for which reason she was nineteen and still single. On the occasion of the Lantern Festival, she visited the Temple of the Ten Kings. At the time, there was a large assortment of people milling around, among whom was an unscrupulous thug who spied on her lustfully, followed her, and made inquiries about where she lived.\n\nThat night, he used a ladder to enter the house, made a hole in her bedroom door, killed a maidservant at her bedside, then attempted to rape the daughter; she used all her strength to resist him and screamed, which made the thug furious, so he killed her, too.\n\nWu’s wife, who’d heard some of the noise, called for a maid to go check on it, and when she spotted the daughter’s corpse, she was further mortified to find it decapitated. Once the whole family had been startled awake, they put the daughter’s body in the main room of the house and laid her head beside the neck, while the entire household wept and howled all night long.\n\nAt dawn, when they lifted the daughter’s shroud, they found the body as they’d left it—but her head was gone. All of the serving women were flogged for not being vigilant in their duty, since it was assumed that the head had been eaten by dogs.\n\nWu then reported the events to the prefecture’s officials. They set a strict timetable for the capture of the criminal, and three months elapsed, but they couldn’t apprehend the murderer. Over time, word got back to Master Wu about the strange exchange of heads in the Zhu family.\n\nWu became suspicious and sent an old woman to find out what the family had been up to; as soon as she walked in and saw Zhu’s wife, the old woman ran off, startled, to inform Master Wu. He verified that his daughter’s corpse was still there, so, alarmed and apprehensive, he just couldn’t figure out what had happened. He began to speculate that Zhu had employed some kind of magic to kill his daughter, so he left to interrogate Zhu.\n\nZhu told him, “My spouse’s head was switched in a dream, but I really have no idea how it was done; to say that I killed her would be an injustice.”\n\nWu didn’t believe him, so he initiated legal action. Zhu’s servants were rounded up and their stories proved to be the same as his. Hence the prefectural officials were unable to prove Zhu guilty.\n\nZhu went home and begged Lu to advise him. Lu declared, “This is no problem, for I’ll just send his daughter to explain it to him herself.”\n\nWu dreamt that night that his daughter said to him, “Yang Danian of Suxi is the criminal who did this to me, not the scholar, Zhu. He wasn’t happy with his wife’s looks, thus _panguan_ Lu took my head and exchanged it—so although my body is dead, my head lives on. I hope you won’t treat him like an enemy.” Upon awakening, he informed his wife, who revealed that she’d had the very same dream.\n\nThey then reported the information to the authorities. The officials’ investigation discovered that there was indeed a Yang Danian; after being arrested and shackled, he confessed to his crime. Wu then paid a visit to Zhu, requesting to see his wife, and afterwards began treating Zhu like his son-in-law. The head of Zhu’s wife was subsequently joined with the body of Wu’s daughter and interred together.\n\nZhu made three more tries at passing the next examination level, but each time he was punished with forfeiture of his candidate’s position because he disobeyed the rules of the examination. As a result, he became discouraged and gave up, and went on with his life for the next thirty years.\n\nOne night, Lu remarked to him, “You know, you can’t live forever.” Zhu asked him how much time he could expect, and the answer was that he had five days.\n\n“Can you save me?”\n\nLu replied, “It’s heaven’s decree, so how can a common person privately hope to resist it? Moreover, a wise man perceives that life and death are a single continuum. Why must life necessarily be a cause for celebrating, and death a cause for lamenting?” Zhu took this to be quite right. Without delay, he obtained appropriate burial clothes, a shroud, and a coffin; once this was done, he dressed himself in his funeral robes and died.\n\nThe next day, while his wife was weeping beside his coffin, Zhu suddenly drifted in from outside. His wife was quite shaken. Zhu acknowledged, “I’m a ghost, that’s for sure, but otherwise no different than I was during my lifetime. I’ve been thinking about you, a widowed mother with an orphaned son, and the loving reluctance to part that I feel for you.” His wife was deeply moved, sobbing till the tears dripped onto her chest; Zhu did his best to console her.\n\nShe pleaded, “In ancient times, there were spirits who returned to life, and since you still possess your spirit, why can’t you live again?”\n\nZhu answered her, “What has been predestined may not be evaded.”\n\n“What do the officials of the underworld have you doing?” she asked.\n\nHe explained, “_Panguan_ Lu recommended me for a position supervising case records, and conferred an official’s title on me, so it’s not unpleasant.”\n\nHis wife wanted to speak with him further, but Zhu said, “Official Lu has come along with me, so I hope you can provide us some wine and food.” Then he hastened away.\n\nHis wife complied with his request, managing to get everything ready. When she heard them laughing and drinking, making high-spirited sounds, it was just like the way things used to be. At midnight, she peeked in and was sad to discover that they’d both vanished. But from that time forward, every three days or so, they’d come back, and occasionally Zhu would even stay all night and make love to her, giving her useful advice on managing the family’s affairs whenever he passed through.\n\nHis son, Wei, was five years old, so when Zhu arrived, he always hugged him; when Wei was seven or eight years old, Zhu taught him by the light of a lamp to read. His son was also very bright, able by the age of nine to compose essays, and at fifteen entered a county school, never realizing that he had no father. After this, Zhu’s visits became more infrequent, no more than one day per month.\n\nOne evening he arrived and said to his wife, “It’s time now for me to say farewell to you forever.”\n\n“Where will you go?” she asked.\n\nHe replied, “The underworld emperor has asked me to serve as the mountain god in Taihua, and I must travel far away to go there. There will be a great distance between us, and I’ll have lots of business to conduct there, so for those reasons I cannot return.” The mother and son clung to him, weeping, so he told them, “Don’t be like that! My son has distinguished himself, the family’s livelihood will allow you to survive, and even a couple who remain married for a hundred years must sometimes be apart!”\n\nHe turned to his son and said, “Be a good man, and don’t neglect your father’s estate. Ten years from now, we’ll see each other again.” He walked directly out through the gate and then disappeared.\n\nAfter Wei turned twenty-five, he succeeded in qualifying as a _jinshi_ and was made an official inspector. He was directed to offer sacrifices at Xiyue while traveling through Huayin, when suddenly a carriage appeared, entirely covered by plumes, galloping frantically to intercept them. Wei was quite surprised.\n\nUpon careful scrutiny, he spotted the person inside the carriage and realized that it was his father. He climbed down from his own carriage and prostrated himself, weeping, by the side of the road.\n\nHis father stopped his carriage and declared, “Your reputation as an official is excellent, so now I can die without regret.” Wei remained on the ground, not getting up; Zhu urged his chariot to go quickly and didn’t look back.\n\nBefore he’d gone very far, he did turn back, untied the sword fastened at his waist, and sent one of his men to present it to Wei. His words sounded as though from far away: “Wear this and you will always be esteemed.” Wei, wishing to chase after him, saw the carriage, horses, and his father’s followers all flutter away suddenly as if scattered by the wind, and in the space of a breath there was nothing left to see.\n\nWei grieved sorrowfully for quite a long time; then he drew the sword and looked closely at it, noting its superior craftsmanship and a phrase carved in characters upon it: “Desire to be brave when making decisions, but prudent in considering them; tactful in wisdom, but equitable in actions.” Wei afterwards became an official comparable to the Simas. He had five sons, called Chen, Qian, Tang, Hun, and Shen.\n\nOne evening, he dreamt that his father told him, “The sword you wear should be given to Hun.” Wei followed his wishes. Hun became an official, a court examiner with a reputation for administration.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “To cut off the leg from the crane in order to connect it to the duck is to commit an act of absurdity; but to graft a flower from one tree to another is to do something extraordinary; this is even more true when chopping through guts and applying knives to the napes of necks! Official Lu can be said to have been ugly on the outside, but beautiful on the inside. From the Ming dynasty to the present day is not a great distance in time—but does Lingyang’s Official Lu still exist? Is his spirit still around or not? To wield the lash merely as his carriage driver would be my greatest delight.”",

        "body": "Wang Zifu lived in Luodian, in Ju county. His father had died when he was very young. Being quite clever, at the age of fourteen, Wang qualified as a _xiucai_. His mother was extremely fond of him and normally didn’t allow him to stray beyond the city limits. He had been engaged to a daughter of the Xiao family who died before they could wed, so to date he’d been unsuccessful at obtaining a bride.\n\nWhen the Lantern Festival arrived, his cousin, Wu, invited him to do some sightseeing. When they’d just reached the village outskirts, a servant from Wu’s family ran up, summoning Wu to return home. Wang saw that there were groups of girls out wandering around, so he decided to continue strolling by himself.\n\nAccompanied by a maid, there was a young woman holding a branch of plum blossoms, a matchlessly gorgeous beauty, whose smiling face captivated him. Wang glued his eyes on her, without a second thought concerning proper behavior. The girl walked past him several paces, then turned to her maid and said, “That young man has eyes that blaze like a thief’s!” Leaving the plum blossom branch behind on the ground, laughing and chattering, she walked away.\n\nWang picked up the branch, disappointed, feeling as if he’d lost his very soul, and then sadly returned home. Once in the house, he slipped the blossoms under his pillow, laid down and went to sleep, refusing thereafter to speak to anyone or to eat anything. His mother became very worried about him. Priests were summoned to put a stop to his decline, but only made things worse. His flesh toughened like hide, and he dropped an alarming amount of weight. Doctors examined him, prescribing medicines that only worked to bring the internal causes of his condition to surface on his skin, and he lay there as if in a trance. His mother caressed him and asked what was causing his condition, but he remained silent, offering no answer.\n\nRight at that time, Wu arrived, so Wang’s mother urged him secretly to find out what was going on. Wu went to his cousin’s bedside, and Wang’s tears fell when he saw him. From the edge of the bed, Wu sought to put him at ease, little by little working toward the source of the problem. Wang revealed the matter and begged Wu to help him plan what to do.\n\nWu laughed and said, “Your overreaction is ridiculous! What’s so tough about fulfilling your desire? I’ll go locate her. Since she was out and about on foot in the countryside, she must not be from an influential family. If she’s not already betrothed, surely we can come to an agreement; and even if she is, we’ll go all out with a heavy bribe and surely that’ll settle the matter. But you have to take care of yourself, while I take care of everything else.” When Wang heard this, his face relaxed into a smile.\n\nWu went and informed Wang’s mother that the issue was a girl who lived in the vicinity, and though he subsequently searched and inquired thoroughly, he could find no trace of her. The mother was terribly worried, but there was simply nothing else to try to do. However, just after Wu had left to search, Wang’s outlook brightened, and he began to eat and move around.\n\nSeveral days later, Wu came again. Wang asked him how his plan was working. Wu fibbed, “I found her. I was curious who she was, and it turns out she’s my aunt’s daughter—so she’s also your cousin, and she’s still waiting to be married. Even though you’re closely related and there is resistance to allowing cousins to marry, when we tell her how you feel, surely anything is possible between the two of you.”\n\nWang’s happiness spread over his face as he asked, “Where does she live?”\n\nWu made something up: “In the hills to the southwest, about thirty _li_ or so.” Wang repeatedly begged him to settle the matter, so Wu vigorously swore he would take care of it and left.\n\nHence Wang began drinking and eating again, getting better gradually, each day bringing him closer to recovery. When he looked under his pillow, he found the plum blossoms had dried up, though the petals hadn’t dropped off. He took pleasure from concentrating while holding them, imagining he could almost see her.\n\nHe thought it strange that Wu hadn’t come back, so he sent a note inviting him to visit. Wu put him off by claiming that he had a prior invitation to honor. Wang was indignant, and became depressed. His mother was afraid that his illness would return, so she anxiously discussed the possibility of another marriage; this strategy was unproductive as Wang simply shook his head, unwilling to talk about it, and spent his days waiting for Wu.\n\nAll the while, Wu sent no report of his efforts, merely increasing Wang’s anger. He began thinking about those thirty _li_—that wasn’t so far, was it? Why wait for news from someone else? Stowing the plum blossoms inside his sleeve, he went off in a huff by himself, without his family knowing anything about it.\n\nTraveling alone, with no one around to give him directions, Wang nevertheless made a beeline for the southern hills. After covering about thirty _li_, he found himself disoriented, with mountains on all sides, but awed and energized by the landscape’s lush greenery, till finally he came across a precipitous path. Looking into the distance, at the bottom of a valley he saw a thicket of flowers and trees, and he could just barely make out a small village nestled there.\n\nComing down from the mountain, he entered the village, noticing that while there weren’t very many huts, each had a thatched roof that was, in Wang’s opinion, of sophisticated construction. One hut faced north, with willow trees in front of its gate, while inside its wall, peach and apricot trees were in full blossom, alternating with pruned bamboo; he heard wild birds singing there. Figuring this for a family garden, he didn’t dare just barge in.\n\nWhen he turned to go, opposite the entrance he found a gigantic stone, smooth and clean, so he decided to sit down and take a little rest. Instantly from the other side of the wall he heard a girl calling, “Xiaorong,” her voice lovely and delicate. As he sat there listening, he noticed a girl walking back and forth, holding an apricot blossom, who lowered her head to fix it in her hair. When she raised her head and saw Wang, she didn’t fasten it with her hairpin, but instead picked up the blossom and ran laughing with it into the garden.\n\nCarefully scrutinizing her, Wang realized it was the girl he’d encountered in the road during the Lantern Festival. His heart was filled with joy. But he couldn’t think of a rationale for entering; he longed to cry out his aunt’s name, but they’d never been introduced and he feared he might be misconstrued as some swindler. There was no one nearby he could question, either. Restlessly sitting, reclining, and pacing back and forth, he watched until late in the day, waiting expectantly, forgetting both hunger and thirst. From time to time, he spotted the girl’s profile when she’d sneak a glance at him, as though surprised that he hadn’t left.\n\nSuddenly, an old woman who walked out supporting herself with a stick, turned to look at Wang and asked, “Where is it you live, since I hear that you got here this morning and you’re still here now? What is it you’re after? Aren’t you feeling hungry?”\n\nWang nervously stood up and bowed respectfully, replying, “I’m here to look for my relatives.”\n\nThe old woman, who was rather deaf, didn’t hear him. He repeated his words more loudly. Then she asked, “What’s their family name?” Wang was stuck for an answer. The old woman laughed, “That’s pretty strange! If you don’t know their family name, how can you hope to find these relatives? By looking at you, I’d guess you’re a bookworm, too. Come on, follow me in—you can eat a little something and there’s a modest bed you can sleep in. Tomorrow you can head home, find out the family name, and then come back here.”\n\nWang’s stomach rumbled at the thought of eating, and besides, accepting would bring him closer to the beauty, so he gladly agreed. Following the old woman inside the gate, he saw a walkway paved with white stones and lined by red flowers whose petals had fallen across the path’s steps; winding to the west, they came to another entryway, where bean trellises and flower frames filled a courtyard.\n\nWang respectfully entered the hut, with its flour-white walls as bright as mirrors; outside the window, a great many wild plum branches were in flower, some of them extending into the room; the mats, stools, and bed were all clean and fresh. As soon as Wang sat down, he felt that there was someone outside the window spying on him.\n\nThe old woman called out, “Xiaorong! Go fix some millet quickly.” From outside, the maid answered in a high voice. As he sat there, Wang laid out the details of his family tree. The old woman asked him, “Was your mother’s grandfather by any chance named Wu?”\n\nHe replied, “He was, indeed.”\n\nAmazed, the old woman declared, “You’re my nephew! Your mother is my younger sister. For years now, our family has been poor, and since we also have no son, we lost all contact with your family. Nephew, you’re all grown up, yet we’ve never met for me to get to know you.”\n\n“I came here to find my aunt,” said Wang. “In all my anxiety, I forgot your name.”\n\nThe old woman explained, “My family name is Qin, but I never gave birth to a child; my adopted daughter, Yingning, was the daughter of a concubine. When her mother remarried, she was left behind for me to raise. While she’s certainly no simpleton, she’s received little proper teaching, so she’s always having fun and never worrying about anything. In just a bit, I’ll send for her to come and meet you.”\n\nNot much later, the maid served a meal of tender chicken, with plenty to accompany it. The old woman encouraged Wang to eat his fill, and afterwards the maid cleared away the dishes. The old woman instructed her, “Tell your mistress, Ning, to come here.” The maid answered affirmatively and left to do so.\n\nAfter a good long while, they heard the sound of muffled laughter outside the door. The old woman called out, “Yingning, your cousin’s here.” The giggling and laughter outside the door didn’t stop. The maid pushed her into the room, Yingning still covering her mouth since she couldn’t stop her laughter.\n\nThe old woman gave her a stern look and said, “We have a guest here; is this any way to behave, with derisive snickering?” The girl restrained her laughter and stood still while Wang bowed respectfully to her. The old woman explained, “This is Master Wang, your aunt’s son. We’re part of the same family, yet we’ve never met each other—now _that’s_ enough to make a person laugh.”\n\nWang asked, “How old is my cousin?” The old woman didn’t catch his question. Wang voiced it a second time. The girl started laughing again so hard that she couldn’t even raise her head up.\n\nThe old woman said to Wang, “I told you she’s had little by way of teachings and admonitions, as you can readily see. She’s sixteen years old and as foolish in judgment as a baby.”\n\nWang noted, “One year younger than I am.”\n\nShe replied, “If you’re seventeen, weren’t you born in the Year of the Horse?” Wang nodded in response.\n\nShe asked again, “Who is your wife?”\n\n“There isn’t one,” he answered.\n\n“Someone with your talent and looks,” she said, “how can you be seventeen and still unmarried? Yingning isn’t betrothed yet either, and the two of you would be well matched; it’s a pity that your being close relatives makes it unlikely.” Wang was speechless, not taking his eyes off Yingning even to blink.\n\nThe maid turned to the girl and whispered, “His eyes are still blazing—the thief hasn’t changed his tune!”\n\nYingning burst into laughter again, turned to the maid and said, “Shouldn’t we check to see if the peach blossoms have opened?” She quickly got up, covering her mouth with her sleeve, and with tiny, quick steps, hurried away. Once she was outside the gate, she let loose her laughter.\n\nThe old woman also got up and called for the maid to prepare a bed so Wang could spend the night. She told him, “It wasn’t easy for you to get here, so it’s only right you should stay for a few days and relax, then we’ll send you home. If you grow tired or bored with the quiet, there’s a garden behind the hut, with various ways there for you to pass the time; or there are books you can read.”\n\nThe next day, Wang went out behind the hut and found a garden there about half a _mu_ in size, along with a ground cover of grass as soft as felt, plus tree blossoms and catkins; there were three thatched huts in a row, with flowers and trees on all sides of each. As he walked through the flowers, he heard a rustling sound from a treetop, and glancing up, he saw Yingning there. When she saw Wang appear, she laughed so hard she almost fell down.\n\nWang cried, “Don’t do that, you’ll fall!”\n\nThe girl climbed down, laughing all the way, unable to stop herself. Just as she was about to reach the ground, she almost lost hold and fell down, her laughter finally coming to a halt.\n\nWang helped her up, taking advantage of the moment to fondle her wrist. This started Yingning laughing again until she had to lean against a tree for support, unable to go on, and it was a good long while before she could stop. Wang waited for her to finish laughing, then took the plum blossoms from his sleeve to show her.\n\nYingning accepted them from him and exclaimed, “They’re all dried up. Why keep them?”\n\nHe answered, “During the Lantern Festival, cousin, you left them behind—that’s why I’ve kept them.”\n\n“If they’re not fresh, what’s the point?” she asked.\n\nWang explained, “To show my love, and that I’d never forget you. Since we first met, I’ve thought about you so much that I became ill, and it caused so much turmoil inside me that I almost died, faced with the possibility of never seeing your face again; I hope you’ll take pity on me.”\n\n“It’s no big deal,” Yingning said. “For a relative, what price is too great to pay? When the time comes for you to go, I’ll call on an old servant to pick a big bunch of flowers from the garden so you can take them with you.”\n\n“Are you crazy?” Wang demanded.\n\nShe asked, “What’s crazy about that?”\n\nWang explained, “It’s not the flowers I care about, but the person who was holding them.”\n\n“Naturally, since relatives love each other,” said Yingning.\n\nWang said, “I’m not talking about the love between relatives, but between a husband and wife.”\n\n“There’s a difference?” Yingning wondered.\n\n“At night, they sleep together,” he explained.\n\nYingning bowed her head and thought about this for a very long time before remarking, “I’m not accustomed to sleeping with strangers.” Before her words were finished, the maid quietly appeared and Wang fled in embarrassment.\n\nA little later, they met back at the old woman’s place. She asked them, “Where’d you go?” Yingning replied that they’d been in the garden, talking together. The old woman said, “The meal’s been ready for a long time—you spoke to each other for so long, there must have been plenty to cover.”\n\nYingning said, “Elder brother wants to sleep with me.”\n\nShe’d barely spoken the words when Wang, horribly embarrassed, anxiously gave her a silencing glance. Yingning giggled and said no more. Fortunately, the old woman hadn’t heard, so she kept on chattering, pursuing her questions.\n\nWang swiftly spoke up to gloss over the comment, then whispered a rebuke to Yingning. She asked, “Isn’t it proper I should mention it?”\n\nWang told her, “It’s the kind of thing you only say behind a person’s back.”\n\n“Behind someone else’s back, maybe,” said Yingning, “but surely not behind my aged mother’s back. Everybody has to sleep somewhere, that’s always the case—so what’s there to avoid?” Wang was frustrated with her naïveté, since he was unable with his attempts to make her understand. Just as they finished eating, a member of Wang’s household arrived with a pair of donkeys, searching for him.\n\nApparently, when Wang didn’t come home after a long time, his mother had become worried; a search party hunted for him repeatedly in the village, failing to turn up the slightest trace of him. Hence she went to consult Wu. Wu recalled the words he’d spoken to Wang, and directed her to search for him in the hills southwest of the village. The servant looking for him had gone to several villages before coming to this place. Wang had walked outside the gate just as he happened past, so he went back inside to tell the old woman and to beg her to let him take Yingning home with him.\n\nThe old woman gleefully said, “I’ve desired this myself, for some time. But my decrepit old body can’t make such a journey, so if you’ll take your cousin to meet her aunt, that will be splendid!” She called for Yingning. Ning came in, laughing. The old woman demanded, “What’s so funny that you can’t stop laughing all the time? If you weren’t always laughing, you’d be a perfectly proper person.” Because she was angry, she glared at Yingning. Then she said, “Elder brother wants to take you home with him, so hurry and get your things packed.”\n\nMeanwhile, she offered Wang’s servant some wine and food, then walking them out later, she told Yingning, “Your aunt’s family owns a great deal of land and goods, so they can afford to support an extra person. You should stay with them rather than returning home, learn a bit of poetry and proper conduct, and also practice caring for your future in-laws. Also plead with your aunt to help you select a good husband.”\n\nWang and Yingning then started off. Once they got to the foot of the mountain, they turned around and could just barely see the old woman leaning on the gate, looking northward in their direction.\n\nWhen they arrived at Wang’s home, his mother was astounded at the beautiful girl accompanying him, and asked who she was. Wang answered that she was his aunt’s daughter. His mother said, “What Wu told you before was all a fabrication. I don’t have a sister, so how can I have a niece?”\n\nShe asked this of Yingning, who replied, “I’m not my mother’s child by birth. My father belonged to the Qin family, but he died when I was still a baby in swaddling clothes, so I can’t recall the details.”\n\nWang’s mother said, “My elder sister did marry into the Qin family, but she was barren; she died a long time ago, so how could she have come back to life?”\n\nHence she carefully interrogated Yingning about the features of her sister’s face, and the location of moles, and one by one they matched exactly. Still suspicious, she stated, “That’s all well and good. But she died many years ago, so how can she be alive now?” Just as she was mulling over her doubts, Wu arrived, and Yingning slipped away to her room.\n\nWu requested all the details and became very quiet for some time. Suddenly he asked, “This girl—is her name Yingning?” Wang affirmed it was. Wu earnestly noted that this was a strange business. Asked how he knew her name, Wu replied, “After my aunt, who joined the Qin family through marriage, died, uncle lived as a widower in his house until he was seduced by a fox, grew ill, and died. The fox gave birth to a daughter named Yingning, who was wrapped up and laid on a bed, as witnessed by every member of the family. After uncle died, the fox still kept coming around; after we requested that a Daoist charm be pasted up on the wall, the fox took her child and left. Couldn’t this be the daughter?” They mutually discussed their suspicions.\n\nBut from inside her room, they could hear the sound of Yingning’s chortling laughter. Wang’s mother remarked, “That girl is just too silly.”\n\nWu asked to meet her. Wang’s mother entered her room, where Yingning was still roaring in laughter and didn’t even notice her at first. Wang’s mother urged her to go out to see Wu, so she used every bit of her strength to resist laughing, turning her face to the wall several times, and then finally came out.\n\nAs soon as she finished greeting the others respectfully, she quickly ran back inside and let loose a hearty guffaw. All the women in the house joined in her laughter. Wu suggested that he go and discreetly investigate the mystery surrounding Yingning, in order to make arrangements for the marriage.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the village, the huts and everything else had disappeared, with only the fallen petals of the mountain flowers remaining. Wu remembered that the place where his aunt had been buried was not far away. However, the grave had become entirely overgrown, making it impossible to determine precisely where it was located, so with a sigh of frustration, he went back.\n\nWang’s mother was convinced that Yingning was a ghost. She went in and informed her of Wu’s report, but Yingning wasn’t the least bit startled; Wang’s mother sympathized with her for having no family, but not only did Yingning show no sign of sorrow, she kept on laughing naively. No one there could make sense of it.\n\nWang’s mother arranged for Yingning to share sleeping quarters with her youngest daughter. Each morning at daybreak, Yingning dutifully paid her respects to Wang’s mother, and the exquisite precision of her needlework was unsurpassed. But even when it was forbidden, her friendly laughter couldn’t be stopped; and there was a charming quality to it, so even when it was wildly uninhibited, her laughter didn’t damage her attractiveness, and it made everyone else feel good. Both the girls and the women in the neighborhood competed for opportunities to welcome her.\n\nWang’s mother chose an auspicious day for the wedding, but she still fretted that Yingning might be some kind of evil spirit. She covertly spied on her in the daylight, but she didn’t see anything unusual in the shape of her shadow.\n\nWhen the wedding day arrived, they had her magnificently dressed for the marriage ritual; but Yingning was laughing so hard that she was unable to kneel properly, so they gave up that part of the ceremony. Because of all her foolishness, Wang feared she might divulge the details of their sexual intimacy; but Yingning was especially careful, and didn’t give anything away with her words.\n\nWhenever Wang’s mother became worried or angry, Yingning would appear, and even a single laugh would make her feel better. If the servants or maids ever went a little too far and feared they might suffer a whipping for their actions, they’d beg Yingning to visit Wang’s mother and speak on their behalf; the guilty maids who trusted themselves to her mediation were usually excused.\n\nBut she had a persistent craving for flowers, searching high and low for them, from relatives and friends; she even pawned a gold hairpin to purchase the seeds for especially beautiful varieties, until after several months there wasn’t a stair, pathway, fence, or outhouse that wasn’t surrounded by flowers.\n\nIn the rear of the courtyard, there was a trellis of banksia roses that had been planted by the family of the neighbor to the west. Yingning often climbed up it to pick some flowers to wear in her hair for fun. Wang’s mother would scold her whenever she saw her doing so. Yingning, however, would never change her ways.\n\nOne day, the neighbor’s son saw her and couldn’t take his eyes off her, he was so smitten by her beauty. Yingning didn’t try to avoid him, but just laughed. The neighbor’s son thought she was making herself available to him, so his heart filled with desire. Yingning pointed to a place at the base of the wall, laughed, and then climbed down, while the neighbor’s son, thinking she was proposing a rendezvous there, was deliriously happy.\n\nOnce night fell, he went to the spot, and Yingning was already waiting there. He pulled her close and thrust himself into her, but felt something like an awl stab his privates with a pain that penetrated to his very heart, and after screaming madly, he stumbled and fell. On closer examination, he saw that it wasn’t Yingning, but a rotten log leaning against the wall, and the place he’d thrust into was a soggy knothole.\n\nWhen his father next door heard him yell, he hurriedly rushed over to find out what had happened, but his son merely groaned and wouldn’t say anything. Once the man’s wife appeared, however, the son told them everything. When they lit a torch and examined the knothole, they saw that inside it was a huge scorpion, the size of a small crab. The old man split the log open, then caught and killed the scorpion. He hoisted his son onto his back and carried him home, where he died in the middle of the night.\n\nThe neighbor brought a suit against Wang, alleging that Yingning was a demon spirit. The county magistrate, who thought of Wang as an admirable man of talent and knew he was a scholar of sincere and honest intentions, determined that the old neighbor was making a false accusation, and was about to have him beaten as punishment. Wang interceded to have the sentence dropped, so the matter was cleared up and the neighbor released.\n\nWang’s mother told Yingning, “This idiocy has gone far enough, and I knew that this excessive frivolity was covering up something worth worrying about. It’s lucky for you that the magistrate didn’t implicate you; if he’d been a muddle-headed official, you’d certainly have been arrested and tried in court—how could my son and I face our relatives and neighbors then?”\n\nYingning wore a serious expression and swore she’d never laugh again. Wang’s mother said, “People don’t have to stop laughing, but they mustn’t do it all the time.” But because of all this, Yingning never laughed again, and even if she was teased, she still wouldn’t laugh; but she also never, ever looked sad.\n\nOne night, Yingning’s face was streaked with tears. Wang found this very strange. “In the past,” she said, choking back sobs, “because we’d only been together a short while, I was afraid you’d be shocked if I told you something. Now that I see how much you and your mother have gone through for me without resentment or suspicion, being frank with you can’t possibly harm our relationship, can it? The concubine who gave birth to me was a fox. When my mother was about to go away, she left me to be raised by the ghost of my father’s wife, and we’ve depended upon each other for more than ten years, which is why I’ve come to you now. I have no brothers, so I can depend upon no one but you.\n\n“My old mother lies alone in the mountains, with no one to pity her or to bury her properly, so she wanders the underworld in grief and sorrow. If the trouble and expense wouldn’t be too great for you, you could take away the pain of someone’s suffering down below and also make the point that adopted daughters are not useless, and shouldn’t be drowned or abandoned.” Wang promised he would take care of it, but he was concerned that the grave might be so obscured by undergrowth that they couldn’t find it. Yingning assured him he didn’t need to worry.\n\nOn the designated day, they set out with a cart and a coffin. Yingning directed them to a desolate spot in the mists and tangled growth, pointed to show them the gravesite, and indeed they found the old woman’s corpse, her leathery skin still intact. Yingning caressed the body, weeping piteously from the pain of her grieving. They carried the body away, sought for and located the family graves, and buried her there.\n\nThat night, Wang dreamt that the old woman came to thank him, and when he woke up, he told Yingning. She informed him, “I saw her last night, but she insisted that I not bother you.” Wang was sorry that she hadn’t been invited to stay. Yingning replied, “She’s a ghost. There are so many mortals here that the _yang_ force is overwhelming, so how could she stay here for long?”\n\nWang asked her about Xiaorong, and she explained, “She’s also a fox, and exceedingly crafty. My fox mother asked her to look after me, and she always gave me cakes and other treats, so I owe her a lot and always think about her. Yesterday I asked mother about her, and she said Xiaorong is already married.”\n\nEvery year on the day of the Cold Food Festival, husband and wife would visit the Qin family graves, paying their respects and sweeping them clean. When a year had passed, Yingning gave birth to a son. Even while he was still a baby in his mother’s arms, he was never afraid of strangers, and laughed at every person he saw, much like his unpredictable mother.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Observing her endlessly silly laughter, it seemed like she was no great prize; and it would be hard to come up with something more cunning than the nasty trick at the base of the wall. But considering the pity and love shown her ghostly mother, that turned her laughter into weeping, I believe her laughter nearly covered up the real Yingning. I’ve heard that in the mountains there is an herb called ‘Xiaoyihu.’ One sniff of it and you can’t stop laughing. If some of this was grown in a home, then neither silk trees nor day lilies could match it for appeal. Even the ‘flower that understands words’ is only a pretender compared to Xiaoyihu.”",

        "body": "Ning Caichen was from Zhejiang. Generous and open-hearted by nature, he comported himself scrupulously. He was always telling people, “In my life, there’s no woman for me but my wife.” Traveling to Jinhua one time, he arrived just north of the city and stopped to rest in a Buddhist monastery. The temple’s halls and pagodas were quite splendid; however, the grounds were covered by weeds and thistles, there was no one around, and furthermore, there were no signs that anyone had walked through there. On the east and west sides of the monks’ housing, there were pairs of doors casually closed; yet the door of the small hut on the south side had been secured with a new lock.\n\nWhen he turned to look into the east corner of the hall, he noticed a dense stand of bamboo; down some steps from it, there was an enormous pool filled with wild flowering lotuses. He felt very happy about the quiet and seclusion of the place. Since scholars were assembling to take the imperial examination in town, the price of lodgings there had skyrocketed, so he thought it might be better to stay at the monastery, and he took a walk while waiting for the monks to return.\n\nAt the end of the day, there was a scholar who arrived and opened the locked southern door. Ning immediately greeted him courteously and informed him of his decision to stay. The scholar replied, “The place has no master, so I’m staying here as a visitor, too. If you can stand the place being overgrown and dilapidated, it would be my very good fortune to learn from you during your stay.” Ning was delighted and proceeded to use some straw to make himself a bed, also setting up a board to serve as a small table, since he planned to be there for some time.\n\nThat night, the moon was shining high and bright, its light as clear as water, as the two men sat on the verandah of the hall and spoke like close friends, revealing their family names to each other. The scholar reported, “My family name is Yan, my courtesy name, Chixia.” Ning figured that he must have come to take the imperial examination, but as he listened to Yan’s accent, he realized he couldn’t be from Zhejiang.\n\nHe asked about this, and Yan replied, “I’m from Shaanxi.” His words were quite frank and sincere. Once they no longer had anything else to discuss together, they bowed to each other and parted company to go to bed.\n\nSince Ning was in an unfamiliar place, for a long time he couldn’t fall asleep. He began to hear the sound of low voices north of where he was staying, like there was a family there. He got up and hid himself just below a stone-lined window on the north side of his room, spying out from his place of concealment.\n\nHe saw a courtyard outside a short wall, where there was a woman in her forties; with her was an old woman, hunchbacked and frail, wearing a gown that had once been dark red, but was now quite worn and faded, the two conversing together by the light of the moon. The woman asked, “What’s taking Xiaoqian so long to arrive?”\n\nThe old woman answered, “She must be almost here.”\n\n“She hasn’t been complaining to you, has she, granny?” the first woman asked.\n\n“Not that I’ve heard,” the other replied, “though she looked like she was upset.”\n\nThe younger woman remarked, “That girl doesn’t appreciate what she has now.” The words were hardly out of her mouth before a seventeen- or eighteen-yearold girl showed up, a peerless beauty.\n\nThe old woman laughed and noted, “One shouldn’t talk about a person behind her back—we two were doing just that when you, you little goblin, quietly sneaked up on us without making a sound. Fortunately, we weren’t saying anything mean about you.” She added, “Young lady, you’re so lovely, you’re like a beauty from a painting, and if I were a young man, you’d have attracted and stolen my very soul.”\n\nThe girl replied, “Granny, if you don’t praise me, who else is going to?” The woman and the girl then exchanged words that Ning couldn’t make out. Thinking that they must be members of his neighbor’s family, he decided to go to sleep without turning back to listen further.\n\nTime passed and there were no more sounds. Just as he was about to drift off to sleep, he sensed that someone had entered his room. He hurriedly got up to investigate, and discovered it was the girl from the courtyard on the north side. Surprised, he asked her what she was doing there.\n\nLaughing, the girl told him, “With the moon so bright tonight, I can’t sleep, so I want to make love to you.”\n\nNing solemnly declared, “You should protect yourself against public censure, for I’m afraid of what people might say; lose your footing even just once, and you’ll end up living in shame.”\n\nThe girl insisted, “It’s late at night, so no one will know.”\n\nNing loudly scolded her again. The girl backed away, then returned as if she had more to say. Ning cried, “Leave me alone! If you don’t, I’ll call and tell the gentleman in the south room.” The girl, frightened, quickly retreated. Once she was outside the door, however, she turned around and came back, placing an ingot of gold on his straw bed.\n\nNing picked up the gold and threw it out into the courtyard, saying, “This filthy thing would defile my moneybag!”\n\nThe girl left, ashamed, picking up the gold and commenting, “This man is as unmovable as stone.”\n\nAt daybreak, a scholar from Lanxi arrived with his servant to wait to take the examination, setting up quarters in the temple’s east side, and that same night he died suddenly. On the sole of his foot there was a small hole, as if it had been pierced by an awl, a tiny bit of blood seeping from it. No one there knew what to make of it.\n\nThe next night, the servant also died, his symptoms the same as the scholar’s. Later that night, when Yan returned, Ning asked him about it, and Yan thought that evil spirits were responsible. Ning had always stood for the right, so this didn’t faze him.\n\nAt midnight, the girl came back to see him, saying, “I’ve encountered many men, but none of them as uncompromising as you. You’re truly a sage, so I don’t dare deceive you. I’m Xiaoqian, my family name is Nie—I died when I was only eighteen, and was buried beside this monastery, where I’m constantly coerced by demons to carry out their foul demands. It’s actually not my own will to turn to people and seduce them. Now that there’s no one left in the monastery to be killed, I’m afraid the evil spirits will come to destroy you.”\n\nHorrified, Ning begged her to help him find a solution. The girl declared, “If you stay in Yan’s room, you can escape them.”\n\nHe asked, “Why can’t they attack Yan?”\n\n“He’s one of those rare people,” she explained, “whom they don’t dare approach.”\n\nThen Ning inquired, “What do you do to the men who become infatuated with you?”\n\n“While he makes love to me,” Xiaoqian replied, “I secretly drill a hole in the sole of his foot, and then when he loses consciousness, I extract his blood for the demons to drink; sometimes I use gold—which isn’t really gold, but the bones of a _luosha_ demon—and anyone who kept it would have his heart and liver cut out: these two tactics ordinarily work on everyone.”\n\nNing was grateful for the information. He asked when he should prepare himself for their coming, and she told him they would come the following night. As she was about to leave, Xiaoqian began weeping and exclaimed, “I’m sinking into a bottomless sea, grasping for land where there isn’t any. Your righteous spirit towers above the clouds, so surely you can find a way to rescue me from my torments. If you’re willing to do this, collect my bones and then bury them in a quiet place—you’d be giving me more than a second life.”\n\nNing pledged to do so for her. When he asked where she was buried, she replied, “Just remember that you’ll find me at the base of a white willow where there’s a crow’s nest.” With these words, she walked out the door and mysteriously vanished.\n\nThe next day, fearing that Yan might go somewhere, first thing in the morning Ning paid a visit to invite him over. By just after 9:00, he’d prepared them wine and food, and he carefully scrutinized Yan as they ate. Afterwards, he suggested that he stay in Yan’s room that night, but Yan declined, explaining that he was unfit for company and was used to being alone. Ning wouldn’t hear of it and peremptorily carried his bedding over to Yan’s quarters.\n\nSince Yan couldn’t get him to stop, he moved his bed over to make room, advising him, “I know you are a moral man, and I respect your innate goodness. I have some important things on my mind, and I’m not in a position to divulge them just now. Please don’t poke around and peek into my chest or clothing, for we’ll both suffer if you disobey my request.” Ning sincerely swore to honor Yan’s words.\n\nThen they both went to bed, Yan placing his chest on the window sill, and the moment he laid his head to rest, he began to snore like rolling thunder. Ning, however, was unable to get to sleep.\n\nNear midnight, he saw the shadow of some indistinct figure outside the window. Immediately it came near the window and peered inside, its eyes flashing with light. Ning was terrified, but just as he was about to cry out for Yan, suddenly something dazzlingly bright like white silk split open the chest and burst out, broke through the stone surrounding the window, and shot out, then quickly reentered the chest like a bolt of lightning.\n\nYan sensed this and got up, while Ning pretended to be asleep, in order to observe him secretly: Yan picked up his chest to examine it, drew something out, then in the moonlight sniffed and inspected it as it gave off a lustrously bright white light, a thing two inches long and about as narrow as a chive leaf. When he was finished, he wrapped it thoroughly in several layers, and put it back inside the now-damaged chest. He said to himself, “What a thing that old demon is—coming here like that took some nerve, and now it’s ruined my chest.” Then he lay back down to sleep.\n\nNing was astonished, so he got up to ask Yan about it, telling him everything he’d seen occur. Yan stated, “Since we’ve come to know each other pretty well, I can risk sharing the secret with you. I am a swordsman. If not for the stone around the window, the evil spirit would have been killed instantly; though it was certainly wounded.”\n\nNing asked, “What is that thing you keep sealed up?”\n\n“My sword,” Yan replied. “When I sniffed it, there was the scent of demon on it.” Ning wanted to have a look at it. Yan generously took it out to show him, revealing a tiny, luminous sword. From that time forward, Ning’s respect for Yan was considerably increased.\n\nThe next day, he looked outside the window and found traces of blood there. Then he walked around to the north side of the monastery, where he found countless overgrown graves, and sure enough there was a white willow with a crow’s nest at its top.\n\nOnce he’d discovered the object of his search, he hurriedly gathered his things, since he wanted to go home. Yan set up a farewell dinner for him to show his great respect for Ning’s upright nature. Afterwards, he offered Ning a worn leather bag as a present, explaining, “This is a sword bag. If you keep this close, no evil spirits will be able to come near you.”\n\nNing wanted Yan to instruct him in his art of the sword. The swordsman told him, “A faithful person like you, outspoken and upright, would certainly be able to practice this art. But you’re a gentleman of wealth and rank, so this is not the path for you.”\n\nNing then provided a pretext for his subsequent actions by saying that he had a younger sister buried there—so he dug up Xiaoqian’s bones, wrapped them up in a winding-sheet, hired a boat, and left for home.\n\nNing’s study overlooked the open country, so he set up a tomb there and buried Xiaoqian’s remains outside his study. He spoke this benediction there: “I felt pity for you, lonely spirit, so I’ve buried you near my home, where we can hear each other, whether singing or weeping, and your grave will no longer be troubled by powerful demons. Here’s a bowl of wine to drink, and though it’s neither refined or delicious, I hope you won’t dislike it!”\n\nFinished expressing his benevolent wishes, Ning turned to go home. From behind him, a person cried out, “Slow down and wait for me to catch up!” When he turned around to look, he saw it was Xiaoqian, laughing merrily and thanking him, saying, “You’re true to your word, and if I were to die for you ten times, it wouldn’t be enough to repay you. Please let me accompany you home, so I can pay my respects to your mother and father; even if you make me your servant, I won’t regret it.”\n\nExamining her carefully, he noted her skin was like a mirror of rosy clouds drifting overhead, her feet like tender bamboo shoots, and as they stood together later in the daylight, he found her even more extraordinarily lovely. Consequently, they went back to Ning’s study. Urging Xiaoqian to sit there and wait a bit, Ning first went in to inform his mother. She was stunned at the news. For a long time, Ning’s wife had been ill, so his mother warned him not to say anything to her, for fear that the news might worsen her condition.\n\nAs they were discussing this, Xiaoqian lightly swept into the room and prostrated herself on the ground, to show her respect. Ning said, “This is Xiaoqian.” His mother was alarmed, not daring to look at her.\n\nThe girl said to her, “I was drifting all alone, far from parents and brothers. Young master Ning rescued me when I was exposed to horrible influences, and to express my gratitude even superficially for the aid he’s given me, I’d be glad to serve him with dishpan and broom to repay his great kindness.”\n\nNing’s mother, seeing that she was both prudent and lovely, felt emboldened to speak with her and said, “Young lady, I appreciate your offer to look after my son, as my old body just isn’t up to it. But he’s my only son and I need him to carry on the family line, so I dare not let him take a ghost wife.”\n\n“Truly, I could never be disloyal to him,” Xiaoqian replied. “Though you’re worried about the honesty of a person from the underworld, please let me stay with you, his mother, and consider him my elder brother, treating you like my own parents, serving you from dawn till dusk—how would that be?” Ning’s mother, sympathetic due to her sincerity, allowed her to stay.\n\nXiaoqian wanted to pay her respects to her sister-inlaw. Ning’s mother rejected the idea, due to the illness of Ning’s wife, so nothing came of it. Xiaoqian then went into the kitchen where she took the mother’s place and prepared a meal. She entered rooms and located beds like she was familiar with all of them.\n\nAt the end of the day, Ning’s mother, still fearful of Xiaoqian, said goodnight and sent her home to sleep rather than setting up a bed for her. Xiaoqian understood what Ning’s mother was feeling, so she finally left. Passing Ning’s study, she wanted to enter, but instead backed away and began pacing back and forth outside his door, as though scared of something.\n\nNing called out to her. She answered, “There’s a sword presence in your room that frightens me. It’s in the way, so that’s why I can’t come in and see you.” Ning realized that the leather bag was the problem, so he grabbed it and hung it up in a different room. Xiaoqian then came in and sat down near his candle. For some time, she was utterly silent.\n\nAfter a long while, she asked him, “Do you read at night or not? When I was little, I used to recite the _Surangama_ sutra, but now I’ve forgotten more than half of it. If you’d let me borrow a copy, at your leisure in the evenings, you could help me to get it right again.” Ning agreed to do so. Once again, they sat in silence until the second watch had passed, not speaking of her leaving.\n\nFinally, Ning urged her to go. Turning pale, she exclaimed, “It’s a strange land that a lonely spirit inhabits—a desolate grave is awfully frightening.”\n\nNing remarked, “There’s no other bed in my study for you to sleep on, and besides, even brothers and sisters should keep their distance, to avoid suspicion.”\n\nXiaoqian stood up, her brows furrowing into a sorrowful look, as though she were about to start crying; dragging her feet and moving sluggishly as she slowly walked out the gate, she made her way to the steps and disappeared. Ning privately pitied her and wished he could let her stay the night on another bed, but he feared this would anger his mother.\n\nEach dawn, Xiaoqian appeared to Ning’s mother, bringing a basin for her to wash in, then turned to managing other activities in the household, never failing to carry out the mother’s will. At dusk, she’d announce her intention to retire, then walk over to Ning’s study, where by candlelight she’d recite from the sutra. Once she could tell that Ning was ready to go to bed, she would leave, miserable once again.\n\nBefore all this, when Ning’s wife first fell ill, Ning’s mother became fatigued, unable to handle the load; the arrival of Xiaoqian was a great relief to her, and in her heart she esteemed the girl. As she became more familiar with her day by day, she came to love Xiaoqian like she was her own child, forgetting meanwhile that she was a ghost; she couldn’t bear to send her away at night any longer, so she invited her to stay and sleep in her room.\n\nWhen she first arrived, Xiaoqian never ate or drank, but after half a year, she began to sip a bit of congee. Mother and son were extremely fond of her, and they treated as off limits the subject of her being a ghost, since no one else could tell it by looking at her.\n\nIt wasn’t long before Ning’s wife died. His mother secretly wanted to accept Xiaoqian as his wife, but she was afraid that no good would come to her son from it. Xiaoqian, sensing this, took the opportunity to inform Ning’s mother, “Since I’ve been living with you for more than a year, you should know what’s going on inside me. I didn’t want to continue bringing disaster to travelers, hence I followed the young master here. I had nothing else in mind, for the young master is straightforward and upright, someone upon whom both heaven and mortals look with respect, so my honest desire was to follow and to support him for three years or so, hoping thereby to win myself some kind of recognition that would confer honor in the world of the dead.”\n\nNing’s mother knew Xiaoqian wasn’t evil, yet she dreaded not being able to extend her family’s line. The girl declared, “Only heaven can grant us children. The young master’s listing in the _Registry of Fate_ says he will have three notable sons, and his taking a ghost wife will not change that.”\n\nNing’s mother believed her, so she discussed the possibility with her son. Ning was elated and arranged for a feast where he could inform his relatives of the news. Someone there asked to meet his new wife—Xiaoqian gladly consented, and came out in a splendid trousseau while everyone stared in astonishment, not because they thought she was a ghost, but because they thought she might be a goddess. Hence the family’s female relatives all presented her with congratulatory gifts, competing with each other to make an impression on Xiaoqian so she’d remember them.\n\nXiaoqian was a talented painter of orchids and plum blossoms, so she returned the favor by making small paintings about a _chi_ in size, and those who were given them, feeling greatly honored, kept them as treasures.\n\nOne day, sitting with her head bowed in front of a window, Xiaoqian seemed worried and depressed. Suddenly she asked Ning, “Where’s that leather bag?”\n\nHe explained, “Since you were afraid of it, I folded it up and put it away somewhere else.”\n\n“I’ve been breathing again with life for quite a while now,” she said, “and I won’t be afraid of it any more so ,you should get it and hang it up at the head of our bed.” Ning asked her why she wanted him to do so, and she replied, “For the past three days, I’ve been continuously nervous and apprehensive because the demons at Jinhua monastery hate me for having escaped, and I’m afraid day and night that one of them is going to come looking to get me.”\n\nNing consequently brought the leather bag out to her. Xiaoqian turned it over repeatedly, examining it very carefully, and then said, “This is what the sword god used to hold the heads of his victims. It looks worn out and tattered, so imagine how many murders it’s responsible for! Just looking at it now makes my flesh crawl.” So they hung it up.\n\nThe next day, Xiaoqian directed Ning to move it and hang it on their door. That night, they sat near the candle, and Xiaoqian made sure that Ning wouldn’t fall asleep. Suddenly something appeared, like a bird falling out of the sky. Xiaoqian was so terrified, she hid herself behind a curtain.\n\nNing got a good look and the thing appeared to be a yaksha, with lightning in its eyes and a bloody tongue—flashing and slashing, it roared up to the front of the house. When it got to the door, it stepped back a pace; hesitating for a long time, it finally came close to the leather bag and snatched it like someone plucking a melon, as though it was about to rip it apart. The bag suddenly made a loud noise, and became as large as a pair of baskets combined; like something from a dream, there was a monster that leapt halfway out of the bag, grabbed the yaksha, and pulled it inside, replacing noise with silence, while the bag instantly shrank back to its normal size. Ning was quite shocked.\n\nXiaoqian came out, overjoyed, exclaiming, “The plague is over!” Together they looked inside the bag, finding nothing more than a large quantity of clear water.\n\nSeveral years later, Ning succeeded in passing the imperial examination as a _jinshi_. Xiaoqian gave birth to a son. Afterwards, Ning added a concubine to his family, who along with Xiaoqian gave birth to two more sons, and all three brothers became influential officials with good reputations.",

I was visiting in Jixia, and just then I was with one of my first cousins, Li Duzhi, drinking by candlelight.\n\nSuddenly, we heard a sound like thunder rolling in from the southeast and heading northwest. Everyone was surprised, unable to identify what was making the noise. An instant later, the table started fluttering and our wine cups toppled over; the room’s beams, rafters, and posts made sounds like they were going to split. We looked at each other and went pale.\n\nAfter some time, we realized it was an earthquake, so we quickly hurried outdoors. We could see that houses, pavilions, and such had been shaken, and were now stabilizing; but there were the sounds of walls collapsing and rooms caving in, of children crying and women wailing, the noise boiling up like a huge cauldron. People were so dizzy that they couldn’t stand up, so they just fell to the ground while the earth contorted beneath them. The river’s waters shot up a _zhang_ over my head, to the accompaniment of squawking ducks and barking dogs.\n\nWhen about an hour had passed, things began to settle down a bit. We noticed that naked men and women had gathered in the street, talking agitatedly to each other, completely forgetting that they had no clothes on.\n\nLater on, I heard that the walls of a particular well had fallen in, so water couldn’t be drawn from it; that a certain family’s pavilion, previously facing south, had shifted to face the north; that Qixia Mountain had been torn open; and that the Yi River had drained into an enormous fissure several _mu_ across. This was a genuinely extraordinary and rare occurrence.\n\nIn my town, there was a man whose wife got up to urinate one night, and when she was walking back, she came upon a wolf holding her infant son in its mouth. The wife immediately began struggling with the wolf. When it opened its jaws, the wife snatched her child back and escaped, carrying it in her arms. The wife then gave a mighty scream. The neighbors came running in response, so the wolf trotted off.\n\nOnce she was no longer terrified, the wife became jubilant, pointing here and there to describe the incident, drawing pictures in the dirt, relating the story of the wolf holding her baby in its mouth, and how she’d grabbed him away through sheer force. It was a considerable length of time before she suddenly became aware that she didn’t have a stitch of clothing on her body, and frantically ran off.\n\nThis was the same thing that happened after the earthquake, when men and women similarly lost track of themselves. When people are frightened and anxious, they don’t think clearly—which is good for countless laughs!",

        "body": "In the East Sea, on Guji Island, there’s a five-colored flower called Winter’s Survivor, that lives through all four seasons without withering. Since ancient times, no one’s lived on the island, and people rarely visit there.\n\nIn Dengzhou, there was a scholar named Zhang, who loved encountering the unexpected, enjoying both traveling and hunting. When he heard that Guji Island was a place of natural beauty, he packed some wine and food, found himself a boat, and set off.\n\nWhen he arrived, he noted the multitudes of flowers, their fragrance carrying for several _li_; and there were trees so large that more than ten people could be fitted around their perimeters. Returning to the sights again and again, reluctant to leave any of them, he felt very contented, enjoying the place tremendously. He opened up his wine, sorry that there wasn’t anyone traveling with him.\n\nSuddenly, a beautiful woman appeared among the flowers, dressed in a red skirt that dazzled the eyes, and to put it briefly, she was simply beyond compare. She saw Zhang, smiled, and said, “I figured my interest in this place was unusual, so I didn’t expect there would be someone who shared my enthusiasm.”\n\nZhang, surprised, asked, “Who are you?”\n\nShe replied, “I’m a courtesan from Jiao prefecture. I traveled here with the Lord of the Sea. He took off to view the scenery, but I was too exhausted to walk any further, so I decided to stay here.” Zhang, who’d been feeling rather lonely, was very pleased to be joined by this beauty, so he invited her to sit and share his wine.\n\nThe woman spoke with words that were warm and enticing, that could turn a man’s thoughts to licentiousness. Zhang consequently was attracted to her. Worried that the Lord of the Sea might return and that they wouldn’t be able to indulge in their mutual pleasure, he suggested they seize the moment and make love. The woman cheerfully agreed.\n\nTheir coupled bodies were showing no signs of slowing down, when suddenly they heard an awe-inspiringly powerful wind, accompanied by the sound of trees cracking and falling. The woman, worried, forced Zhang to get up and cried, “The Lord of the Sea has come.” Zhang threw on his clothes and turned back around, stunned to see that the woman was already gone.\n\nThen he whirled around to see a huge snake coming out from among the trees, its body as thick as an enormous pipe. Zhang was terrified, so he slipped behind a large tree, hoping the snake wouldn’t see him. The snake came right up close to him, then wound its body around both Zhang and the tree several times; his arms were both bound stiffly at his waist, so he couldn’t bend them even a little.\n\nThe snake raised up its head and flicked its tongue repeatedly at Zhang’s nose. Distracted by the blood that began streaming from the nose, which collected in a shallow pool on the ground, the snake then lowered its head and drank from it. Zhang was sure he was going to die, when suddenly he remembered he was wearing a bag at his waist that contained poison for dealing with foxes, so with two fingers he pulled it out, and from the worn bag he was able to take some poison into his palm; then he turned his neck so he was able to look at the palm and the blood from his nose began to drip onto the poison until soon there was enough to fill his hand. The snake consequently came near to drink the blood from his palm.\n\nBefore it could finish drinking, its body abruptly stiffened, then it began thrashing its tail, making a noise like thunder crashing, and every tree that it struck was broken in half, until the snake toppled to the ground like a mighty pillar and died.\n\nZhang felt so dizzy that he couldn’t stand up, and it took some time for him to recover. He collected the snake and went home, where he fell ill for more than a month. He suspected that the woman must have been a snake spirit.",

        "body": "Ding Qianxi lived in Zhucheng. He was wealthy, both in terms of cash and of grain. A champion of justice, he was an admirer of Guo Xie, a truly upright man. A particular corrupt government official began searching for ways to censure him. Ding, consequently, was forced to live as a fugitive.\n\nWhen he arrived in Anqiu, it had begun to rain, so to stay dry he had to give up traveling any further. By noon, the rain still hadn’t let up. A boy came, offering him comfortable lodging and ample food. Since it was already dark, Ding stopped to lodge with the boy’s family; the boy fed some hay and beans to his horse, then considerately served Ding his meal.\n\nDing asked his name, and the boy replied, “The host here is named Yang, and I’m his nephew. The master, who loves to travel, is out now, and of the other family members, only my aunt stayed behind. We’re poor, so we can’t offer a visitor everything he might wish, and we hope you’ll forgive us for that.” Ding asked the boy what his uncle did for a living, and discovered that the family had neither money nor possessions, so during the day they set the place up for gambling, and in that way paid for their food.\n\nThe following day, it rained as before, without stopping, and the boy was never idle in keeping Ding supplied.\n\nWhen night arrived, he gave the horse more hay; but Ding could tell that the sheaf of hay was soaked; it was also cut to many different lengths. He thought this odd. The boy declared, “To tell you the truth, my family’s so poor that we have no livestock to feed, so my aunt took down some thatch from our home’s roof for your horse.” Ding found this stranger yet, figuring the boy was just hinting to him for some extra pay.\n\nAt first light, Ding offered him some money, but the boy wouldn’t accept it; then when he offered it more insistently, the boy took it inside. When the boy came back out, he returned it as before, reporting, “My aunt said that we don’t make our living by serving customers. When the master goes out, even for several days, he doesn’t take along any cash; so when someone comes to stay with our family, how can we demand compensation?”\n\nDing expressed his admiration and commendation of the master, then prepared to take his leave. He instructed the boy, “I’m known as Ding, from Zhucheng—please inform Master Yang that I should like to have him visit me. When he has the leisure to do so, it would be my good fortune to welcome him.”\n\nYears passed, and he heard no news of his former host. Then it happened one year that there was a great famine, and the Yang family became desperate in their poverty. Yang’s wife persuaded him to pay a visit to Ding, so he went.\n\nOnce he arrived, he gave his name at Ding’s gate, but Ding didn’t remember him; once Yang repeatedly explained, however, Ding remembered everything. He slipped on some sandals and ran outside, bowing to his visitor and ushering him inside. When he noticed Yang’s raggedy clothing and worn-out shoes, he brought him to a warm room, laid out a feast, and entertained him with extraordinarily lavish generosity.\n\nThe next day, Ding had a cap and a set of clothes made for Yang, to keep him warm. Yang was grateful; but he worried about his family more and more, anxious that he couldn’t know how they were doing, since he was so far away.\n\nAfter Yang been staying there for several days, Ding still hadn’t said anything particular about offering him assistance once he decided to leave. Yang’s thoughts remained extremely troubled, so he told his host, “When I first saw you, I didn’t dare reveal the facts: when I came here to prostrate myself before you, we didn’t even have a _sheng_ of rice left. Now, due to your kind treatment, I’m fine. But what about my family!”\n\nDing reassured him, “Don’t let it prey on your mind, for I’ve already taken care of the details. I hope you’ll allow yourself the leisure of staying a little longer, so I can help provide you with some traveling expenses.” Then he sent his servants out to summon various gamblers, so Yang could sit there and ask them for a share of their profits, till by the end of the evening he had collected a hundred taels, and Ding saw him off for his return trip.\n\nOnce he was back home, Yang spotted his wife dressed in brand new clothing and shoes, with a young maidservant waiting on her. Startled, he asked what had happened. His wife explained, “The day after you left, servants with carts came to offer us cloth, silk, and grain, piling it all up until they filled a room, saying it was a present from Ding, who was once a guest here. Even this maid was sent to serve me.” Yang couldn’t express how moved he was by all this. Hence his family became moderately wealthy, and Yang never had to resort to his old way of making ends meet.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Poor yet hospitable to visitors—even drinkers and gamblers can be moved to do good; the unusually insightful person here, however, was Yang’s wife. For who _could_ receive assistance and not return the favor? By rightly refusing to forget a single meal he’d received, Ding demonstrated his virtue.”",

When it came time for him to marry off his daughter, he took his family to Jiangnan, and personally purchased his daughter’s trousseau. Once their boat arrived at Gold Mountain, Zhang disembarked, advising his family to stay in the boat and not to fry any fish or meat.\n\nNow there was a monstrously large sea turtle living in the river that would surface whenever it smelled something tasty, wrecking boats and gulping down travelers, and it had been wreaking havoc on the people there for quite some time. When Zhang left, his family members forgot about his warning, and started roasting some meat in the boat.\n\nSuddenly, a gigantic wave capsized the boat, drowning his wife and daughter. Zhang returned to the site, mourning sorrowfully and wishing he were dead. Subsequently, he climbed Gold Mountain to visit a Buddhist monastery, in order to inquire about the monstrous turtle that had become the object of his hatred.\n\nShocked, a monk who heard his story, replied, “We live near it daily, and fear that it endangers people’s lives, so we serve it as a god, and I pray it hasn’t been angered; at regular times we sacrifice livestock, throwing the body segments into the river—then something surfaces, swallows them, and submerges again. Who could hope to survive the enmity of such power!”\n\nWhen Zhang heard this, a plan suddenly occurred to him. It was easy to enlist some blacksmiths, who had set up a forge on the mountainside, to smelt some red iron weighing a few hundred _jin_. When they had learned where the thing most frequently hid itself, they directed two or three strong men to use large tongs to lift the hot iron up and throw it into the river. The monster turtle came up, quickly swallowed it, and went back down.\n\nShortly, waves the size of hills began surging. An instant later, the billows ceased and the monstrous turtle, dead, floated to the surface.\n\nTravelers and monks quickly united and built a temple to old Master Zhang, placing an effigy of him inside it—where they revere him as a water deity, and when they supplicate him, he answers them.",

        "title": "The Shuimang Herb",
        "body": "Shuimang is a poisonous herb. It’s a creeping vine like the kudzu; it also has purple flowers, similar to lentils. Those who eat it by mistake immediately die, and become shuimang ghosts. Popular belief holds that such a ghost will not be reincarnated, and can only be returned to the cycle of life if someone else dies from the poison and can serve as a substitute. For this reason, there’s considerable suffering in the area around Peach Blossom River, where these ghosts are particularly prevalent.\n\nA scholar named Zhu was going to see a “same-year,” a friend who’d been born the same year he had, which involved paying a visit with one’s name-card, calling each other “elder brother” and “younger brother,” and their sons being called “nephews” and calling them “uncles,” a popular custom. As Zhu was heading off to see his same-year, Mou, he felt violently parched along the way, his throat longing for an immediate drink.\n\nSuddenly he spotted an old woman at the side of the road, in a hut, apparently giving out tea to drink, so he hurried over. The old woman welcomed and conducted him into her hut, and hospitably offered him a cup of something that was very dark. He sniffed at it and noticed a peculiar smell, not like tender tea leaves, so he wouldn’t drink it, put it down, and got up to leave.\n\nThe old woman anxiously stopped her guest and shouted, “Sanniang, fetch a cup of the good tea out here.” In a few moments, a young woman, carrying a teapot in her hands, came out from behind the hut. She seemed about fourteen or fifteen years old, looking breathtakingly lovely and captivating, with rings on her fingers and bracelets on her arms, glittering and gleaming, casting varied shadows.\n\nZhu accepted a little cup from her, his thoughts fixated on Sanniang; he sniffed his tea, finding it heavily fragrant and energizing. He drained it and asked for a second cup. He watched the old woman until she turned around, then playfully grabbed the girl’s wrist and took one of her rings off a finger. Sanniang blushed and gave a slight smile, which made Zhu become even more smitten.\n\nHe had intended to ask her where her family was from, but just then the girl told him, “If you come tonight, I’ll still be here.” Zhu begged her to give him a small pinch of her tea leaves, which he put together with her ring, and then he went on his way.\n\nWhen he arrived at the home of his same-year, he began to feel an awful pain in his heart, and suspecting that there was something wrong with the tea, he informed his friend, Mou, of his experience.\n\nHorrified, Mou exclaimed, “You’re in grave danger! They were shuimang ghosts. My late father died of that. Nothing can save you, so what shall we do?”\n\nZhu was terribly afraid, and took out the leaves to examine them, verifying that they were from the shuimang herb. Then he took out the ring, revealing everything about the girl.\n\nMou thought for quite some time, then replied, “She must be Kou Sanniang.”\n\nZhu, surprised that he was familiar with her name, demanded, “How’d you know that?”\n\nMou explained, “In a village to the south, a wealthy family named Kou had a daughter who was known as a great beauty, until she mistakenly ate shuimang and died—undoubtedly she was the malevolent spirit you encountered.”\n\nSomeone there revealed that to deal with such spirits, if one could learn the ghost’s family name and then beg the family for some of the ghost’s former undergarments, the clothing could be boiled and the result could be drunk as an antidote. Mou anxiously paid a visit to the Kou family, fully and accurately informing them of Zhu’s entire story, kneeling for a long time in earnest sorrow, begging for help; but the Kous realized that Zhu was about to serve as a substitute for their daughter who had died, and consequently they turned stingy, refusing to grant his request.\n\nMou returned in anger, and broke the news to Zhu. Grinding his teeth in frustration, Zhu cried, “If I’m to die, it’s certainly not going to be just so their daughter can be reincarnated!” Mou then saw him home in a sedan chair, but just as they were almost at his front gate, Zhu died.\n\nZhu’s mother wailed and wept as she buried him. He left behind him a son who had just turned one year old. His wife was unable to remain a widow, so half a year later, she remarried and moved out. Zhu’s mother cared for her fatherless grandson and fed the little boy all by herself, which was too demanding for the beleaguered grandmother to stand, so she sobbed piteously day and night.\n\nOne day, just as she was holding the child and crying, Zhu suddenly and silently entered the room. His mother, aghast, wiped away her tears and asked him why he had come. He answered her, “I heard your weeping from the underworld, and it made me so grievously sad that I’ve come to serve you, at least paying my respects in the mornings and evenings. Though I am dead, I’ve already taken a new wife, and we’re both going to take over your toil, mother, so don’t be so sad.”\n\n“What kind of person is your wife?” his mother asked.\n\nZhu replied, “The Kou family just sat by and let me die, which I resented violently. After I died, I wanted to find Sanniang, but I didn’t know where to look for her; recently I met with an uncle, who pointed out for me how to locate her. Sanniang had been reincarnated into the family of an official named Ren; I sped there, grabbed her spirit back forcibly, and brought her with me. Now she’s become my wife and we actually get along well together, so she’s suffered no hardship.”\n\nA little while later, a young woman entered through the gate, gorgeously attired and absolutely beautiful, and prostrated herself on the ground to show her respect for Zhu’s mother. Zhu explained, “This is Kou Sanniang.” Though Sanniang was no longer a living person, when Zhu’s mother looked her over, she found herself feeling rather pleased with the girl.\n\nZhu then sent Sanniang to perform the household chores. Though the girl wasn’t accustomed to doing such work, she was so obedient that she nevertheless made it her responsibility wholeheartedly, earning everyone’s love and appreciation. Hence once they moved in with Zhu’s mother, they stayed there and never deserted her.\n\nSanniang requested that Zhu’s mother inform her family about everything that had happened. Zhu didn’t want his mother to do so; but she obliged Sanniang, and in the end reported everything. The head of the Kou family and his wife were greatly astonished by the news, and quickly ordered a carriage to take them back with her.\n\nWhen they saw the girl, they knew it was Sanniang. They hugged her, silently weeping, till she encouraged them to stop their crying. Sanniang’s mother noticed that the Zhus were quite impoverished, which made her all the more upset. Sanniang remarked, “I’m already a ghost, so what difference does it make if they’re poor? Zhu and his mother care about me, generously and faithfully loving me, so I feel entirely at ease here.”\n\nThey asked her then, “Who was the old woman who gave out the tea?”\n\n“Her surname was Ni,” explained Sanniang, “and since she was ashamed of being unable to trick any passersby, she begged me to assist her. Now she’s already been reincarnated into a family that runs a sour-liquor shop in town.” Then she turned to Zhu and said, “You’re already my husband, but you still haven’t yet paid your respects to my parents—how’s that supposed to make me feel?”\n\nZhu abruptly flung himself down to show respect for his parents-in-law. Sanniang then went into the kitchen to act for Zhu’s mother by preparing a meal, which they offered to the Kous. Sanniang’s mother felt wretched about this. She returned home and sent two maidservants back to serve them, plus a great quantity of currency and many bolts of fine cloth and silk; she also had wine and meat delivered frequently as tokens of their good will toward Zhu’s mother, attempting to improve her life a bit.\n\nThe Kous also periodically invited Sanniang to return home and visit them. After several days, she would always say, “There’s no one at home to keep house, so you’d better let me head back before long.” Sometimes when the parents intended to urge her to stay with some kind of excuse, Sanniang would simply fly away home herself. Her father then built a grand house for Zhu, and oversaw that it was furnished with all the best before he left. Nevertheless, Zhu never paid a visit to his father-inlaw’s home.\n\nOne day there came word of a villager who’d been poisoned by shuimang, had died, but had then come back to life, with everyone commenting on the strangeness of it all. Zhu remarked, “I’m the one who revived him. He was killed by a person named Li Jiu, but I drove Li’s spirit away from him and eliminated it.”\n\n“Why didn’t you take over the man when you had the chance?” asked his mother.\n\nHe replied, “I despise that kind of behavior, and since I’ve prevented others from acting like that, how could I stoop to it! Besides, my greatest happiness is is to wait upon my mother, so I have no desire to be reborn.” Henceforth, whenever anyone was poisoned by shuimang, they’d prepare a lavish supplication feast and beg Zhu for rescue, which he always granted them.\n\nWhen just over ten years had passed, Zhu’s mother died. Zhu and Sanniang were grief-stricken, became listless and debilitated, and refused to receive any visitors, only directing their son to put on rough mourning garments and express his sincere sorrow, instructing him in the proper rites, nothing extravagant and wasteful.\n\nAbout two years after they’d buried Zhu’s mother, the parents arranged their son’s marriage to the granddaughter of Ren, the government official. Previously, Master Ren had had a daughter by a concubine, and the girl was only a few months old when she died. After hearing the strange stories about Zhu, he ordered that he be driven to Zhu’s home, where he treated Zhu as his son-in-law and arranged a granddaughter’s marriage to Zhu’s son. Once the granddaughter became the son’s wife, relations between the families were always cordial\n\nOne day, Zhu called his son to him and said, “The gods feel that I have performed meritorious deeds for the common people in the world, so they’ve appointed me as the Dragon Master of the Four Great Rivers, and now it’s time for me to take up my position.”\n\nShortly afterward, in the courtyard they saw four horses appear, pulling an immaculate yellow coach, the thighs of each horse covered with scaled shells. Husband and wife came out, grandly attired, and stepped up into the coach together. The son and his wife tearfully prostrated themselves, and in the space of a breath, the coach had vanished.\n\nThat same day, the Kou family saw their daughter arrive, and she lovingly took her leave of her father and mother, explaining Zhu’s advancement to them. Sanniang’s mother, weeping, pleaded with her to stay, but she simply replied, “My dear Zhu has already gone on ahead.” She walked out the gate then, and was never seen again.\n\nZhu’s son, who was named E, his courtesy name Lichen, begged Sanniang’s father to give her bones to him, and he subsequently buried them alongside his father’s remains.",

Children don’t know about such things, so they’re constantly vulnerable to such harm.\n\nThere’s also another enchantment one can cast that changes people into beasts, called “creating livestock.” The spell is little practiced north of the Yangzi, though it’s quite common in the south. At an inn in Yangzhou, a man leading a five-headed donkey came in and tied it up at the inn’s stable, declaring to the innkeeper, “I’ll be right back.” He quickly added, “Don’t let it eat or drink.” Then he went away.\n\nThe donkey was out in the sun and became agitated, raising a ruckus with its kicking and biting. The innkeeper led it away from the stable to cool off. When the donkey spotted some water, it rushed towards it and indulged itself in guzzling. A moment later, it changed into a woman. The innkeeper was astonished and asked her what had happened, but she was tongue-tied and couldn’t speak. Then he hid her inside the inn.\n\nNot long afterwards, when the donkey’s master returned with five sheep and entered the courtyard, he nervously asked where his donkey had gone. The innkeeper dragged him over to a seat and offered him food, earnestly saying, “For now, sir, enjoy your meal—your donkey will show up quite soon.”\n\nThe innkeeper then stepped out, fed the five sheep with water, and in seconds they turned into five children. The innkeeper secretly sent a message to prefectural headquarters, from whence servants were dispatched to arrest the man, who was subsequently shackled and executed."

        "body": "A scholar from Fengyang county hoisted his bamboo bookcase on his back, and prepared for a long journey. He told his wife, “After six months, I’ll return.” More than ten months later, to her dismay, she’d heard nothing from him. The wife anxiously kept a vigil for him, hoping for his return. One night, while she was resting on her pillow, the moon shining through their cloth-covered window projected a wavering image that made her restless with thinking about being separated from her husband.\n\nJust as she was tossing and turning, a fairy with pearls in her coiled hair, and a crimson cape over her shoulders, pulled aside a curtain and entered, smiling, as she asked, “Big sister, don’t you want to see your husband?” The wife immediately got up and repeatedly said that she wanted to see him. The fairy invited the wife to come with her. The wife was concerned about the difficulties of traveling very far, but the fairy persuaded her not to worry.\n\nShe quickly offered the wife her hand and led her outside, the two walking together in the moonlight for a short while. Then the wife became aware that the fairy was walking quite fast, her pace so brisk that the wife was having a hard time keeping up with her, so she called for the fairy to wait for her while she went back home to put on some other shoes that would enable her to travel faster.\n\nThe fairy led her to sit by the side of the road, took off her own shoes, and gave them to the wife. She gratefully put them on, and fortunately they were a perfect fit. She got up and continued following the fairy, her pace so rapid that she felt like she was flying.\n\nAfter a while, she saw her husband riding towards them on a white mule. When he saw his wife, he was quite surprised, so he anxiously got off the mule and asked, “Where are you going?”\n\nShe replied, “I came to find you.” Then he turned around to look and asked her who the fairy was.\n\nBefore his wife could answer, the beauty hid her laughing mouth behind her hand, and remarked, “Don’t ask anything. Your wife had to rush here frantically and it hasn’t been easy for her; you’ve also traveled urgently for half the night, so the two of you and your mule must be exhausted. My home isn’t far away, so it wouldn’t be too late for you to take a rest from your travels there, and in the morning you can be on your way.”\n\nThey noticed that there was a village not too far away, so they proceeded to enter it. After walking into a courtyard, the fairy urgently woke up a sleeping maidservant to serve her guests, saying, “Tonight the moonlight is so bright that there’s no need for candles, and we can sit on the stone chairs around this little table.”\n\nThe scholar tied his weary mule to a pillar under the house’s eaves, then sat down. The fairy commented to his wife, “My shoes aren’t comfortable for your feet, so weren’t you exhausted on the way? You’ll be able to ride on your way home, so I’d like to ask you to return them to me.” The wife expressed her thanks and handed them over.\n\nSoon wine and fruits were set out, and the fairy poured wine for them, saying, “The married couple have long been apart, but tonight they are reunited; I’d like to drink this cup of wine in honor of congratulating you two.” The scholar also held up his cup and offered his own toasts with more wine.\n\nThe hostess and guests laughed and chatted, becoming quite uninhibited. The scholar stared at their stunning hostess, repeatedly directing glib comments to her as they flirted together. In contrast, the husband and wife hadn’t shared even a single word of intimacy since they’d been reunited. The fairy’s alluring eyes communicated passion while she spoke in suggestive double entendres. The scholar’s wife sat there silently, pretending not to understand their innuendos.\n\nAs they gradually became more and more intoxicated, the words of the two became more explicitly seductive. The fairy encouraged the scholar to drink from an enormous wine cup, but the drunken scholar declined, insisting that he’d already overindulged. Laughing then, he exclaimed, “Sing me a song and I’ll accept your drink.”\n\nThe beauty offered no resistance, strummed a qin with an ivory plectrum, and began to sing:\n\nDusk wipes away all my make-up,\n\nThe cool west wind penetrates the cloth of my window.\n\nI listen to the sound of broad leaves strike,\n\nDrizzle falls in fits and starts.\n\nWhere and with whom can I gossip as I used to do?\n\nI have a burning desire to see him\n\nBut there’s no response.\n\nI weep continually, my tears trailing like ropes.\n\nThinking of him often,\n\nHating him often.\n\nI hold my red embroidered slipper in my hand\n\nTo divine my future from the spirits.\n\nWhen the song was finished, she smiled and said, “This is just a ditty that people sing in the streets, and not worth your listening. But it’s very popular around here, so this is just my version of it.” Her tone of voice was soft, her movements indecently intimate. The scholar was so excited, he could hardly control himself.\n\nBefore long, the fairy pretended to be drunk and left her seat; he also got up and followed her out. A long time passed and they didn’t come back. The maidservant grew tired and laid down to sleep on the porch. The wife sat there alone, abandoned, with no one to talk to, her heart raging with unbearable anger. She considered fleeing for home, but the darkness was intimidating and she couldn’t remember the route that they’d taken.\n\nWith her thoughts churning around and around, she couldn’t come up with a definite plan, so instead she got up to spy on the two. As she crouched near the window, there came the unmistakable sounds of lovemaking, faintly audible. She perked up her ears, hearing her husband whispering all the sweet nothings he had always used to please her in the past, pouring out all those words to the fairy.\n\nBy this point, the wife’s hands were trembling, her heart pounding in her throat, and she decided to run out through the gate, jump into a ravine and die. She had just run outside angrily, when suddenly she saw her second younger brother, Sanlang, ride up on a horse, hastily dismount, and ask what was going on. She told him everything.\n\nSanlang, outraged, returned to the house with his sister, barged inside, and found the door to the fairy’s room bolted shut, with the bedside whispers still coming from inside. Sanlang hefted up a tremendous stone like he was going to use it as a weapon, then pitched it through the window lattice, breaking the window to pieces.\n\nFrom inside a voice screamed, “His brain’s split open! What am I going to do!”\n\nWhen the wife heard this, she panicked and wept hysterically to her brother, “I didn’t mean to conspire with you to kill him, so now what can we do?”\n\nSanlang opened his eyes wide and declared, “You called for me to hurry and aid you; now that I’ve addressed your complaint, you begin to protect your husband and blame it on your own brother—I’ll never listen to you again!”\n\nWhen he turned with the intention of leaving, the wife grabbed at his clothing, pleading, “If you don’t take me along with you, where can I go?” Sanlang pushed his sister to the ground, shook off her touch, and left. The wife suddenly awakened in terror, only then realizing that it had all been a dream.\n\nThat very day, the husband really did return home, riding a white mule. His wife thought this was strange, but didn’t mention it. The scholar, too, had had a dream the previous night, and when he described what he’d seen and experienced in it, the details tallied exactly with everything that had happened in her dream, which scared them both.\n\nNot long afterwards, Sanlang heard that his elder sister’s husband had come home from his travels, so he also visited them to make inquiries. During their conversation, he told the husband, “Last night I dreamt that you’d come home, and now sure enough you have, which is really strange.”\n\nThe scholar laughed and replied, “Fortunately, your boulder didn’t kill me.” Sanlang, stunned, asked him why he’d said that, so the husband told him about his dream. Sanlang found this utterly bizarre. That same night, he’d dreamt that he had found his sister weeping out her accusation, and in violent rage he’d flung the stone. They had three identical dreams, but no one knew from where the fairy had come.",

After I die, either marry someone else or remain loyal to me and take care of my parents—please let me know what you’ll do.” His wife sat silently and wouldn’t speak. Geng remained adamant in his request, adding, “Remaining loyal to me is a fine gesture, but marrying again would be equally acceptable. Tell me the truth about what you intend to do! If you remain loyal to me, it’ll ease my mind; if you marry someone else, I won’t worry about you any longer.”\n\nHis grieving wife then replied, “Our family couldn’t bear your loss—you’re still alive and you mustn’t give up, so how can I answer such a question?”\n\nGeng heard this, hastily grabbed his wife’s arm, and with an edge in his voice, cried, “You’re so cruel!” His words trailed off, and he died. The hand grasping her arm wouldn’t release it. His wife began wailing. Family members came in, two of them reaching for Geng’s fingers, and, using all of their might to pry them off, finally succeeded in opening them.\n\nGeng didn’t know he was dead, so when he walked out past his gate, he saw over ten small carts, each cart carrying ten people, and noticed pieces of paper with names written on them attached to their sides. When one of the cart drivers saw Geng, he urged him to climb on up. Geng observed that previously there had been only nine people in this particular cart, but counting him, there were now ten. Then he examined a list posted on the cart’s side and found his name at the bottom of it.\n\nThe cart traveled along quite noisily, with a vibrating sound that jarred the ears of everyone inside, so Geng was unable to find out where they were going. After a while they stopped, and when he asked where they were, he was told, “Think of this as your your new home town.” Geng became suspicious upon hearing this.\n\nThen he overheard a conversation involving the cart driver, who said in a low voice, “Today they chopped up three people.” Geng was shocked.\n\nWhen he heard these whispered words, he realized that they were talking about the underworld, and demanded, “Have I become some kind of ghost?” He immediately began thinking about his family, and found nothing to worry about except his aged mother, for if his wife wanted to remarry, there’d be no one to take care of her; and as he thought it, he couldn’t stop his tears from flowing.\n\nAs time passed, he noticed that there was a very high platform and many people wandering around it, with cangues over their heads and shackles on their feet, sobbing as they climbed down and climbed up it, and he heard someone say something about “visiting the village stage.” All the people came there, plodding along with restraints on, chaotically vying with each other to climb up. The cart driver would either flog them or detain them, and it was only when it was Geng’s turn that he urgently directed him to start climbing.\n\nHe went up about ten flights of steps, finally arriving at the very top. When he raised his head to look around, he saw a large gate and grand hall. Yet once he was inside, the rooms were barely visible, as though thick with the steam rising from a bamboo cooker. Miserable, he felt crushed.\n\nWhen he looked back, there was a fellow wearing a short, cotton-padded jacket, standing just behind his shoulder, and he promptly inquired if his last name was Geng. Geng confirmed that this was, indeed, his name. The man then told him that he was a craftsman from Donghai. Seeing Geng shedding tears, he asked, “What unfinished business is troubling you?” Geng then told him his story.\n\nThe craftsman hatched a plan for Geng to jump down from the platform and escape with him. Geng was afraid that he’d be pursued through the underworld, but the craftsman firmly insisted that there would be no problem. Geng was also worried about falling and hurting himself from such a height, but the craftsman persuaded him to follow him. He then took the lead and leapt ahead, with Geng determinedly following after him.\n\nWhen they reached the ground, Geng surprisingly no longer felt ill. He was overjoyed not to be noticed. Then he saw that the carts were still parked beneath the platform. The two men anxiously dashed away. After several steps, Geng suddenly recalled that his name was posted on the side of a cart and feared that if he didn’t remove the name, someone would come after him again, so he turned back and crept close to the cart, spit on his fingers, rubbed out his name, then ran away till he was gasping for breath, but didn’t dare stop for an instant.\n\nIn a short time, Geng reached the gate of his house and the craftsman sent him on inside. Suddenly he saw his own corpse there, which then stirred and returned to life.\n\nHe felt exhausted and terribly thirsty, so he hurriedly cried out for some water. His family members, though horribly frightened, brought him plenty of water which he gulped down. Then all of a sudden he stood up, bowed respectfully, and prostrated himself on the ground as though showing someone his gratitude; he walked out the gate with his hands folded together in thanks, then returned.\n\nWhen he went inside, he laid down stiffly and was unable to turn over. His family members thought his actions were pretty odd and began to wonder whether he was really alive; but when they started keeping an eye on him, they found that he wasn’t really acting all that strangely. Coming closer, they wanted to know what had happened to him, so he vividly described everything to them, from beginning to end.\n\n“Why did you walk out through the gate?” they asked him.\n\nHe answered, “Because the craftsman was leaving.”\n\n“Why’d you drink so much water?”\n\n“At first it was only me drinking,” he replied, “but after that the craftsman had some to drink.”\n\nThey brought him some broth, and after several days, he recovered. Because of this, he grew bitter and mean towards his wife, and never again shared bed or table with her.",

        "body": "In Changzhou, there lived a man named Li Hua, who was a wealthy landowner. He was over fifty years old, yet he had no son. There had been a daughter named Xiaohui, possessed of an elegant beauty, whom her father and mother loved dearly. But when she was fourteen, she became violently ill and passed away, causing a chill to settle over their home as their greatest delight in life was taken from them.\n\nLi then took a concubine, and when over a year had passed, she gave birth to a son who was valued like precious jade and was named Zhu’er. The boy gradually grew into a husky fellow of sweet temperament. However, by nature he was also hopelessly dense, so when he was five or six years old he still couldn’t tell the difference between beans and wheat, and he also experienced great difficulty with speaking. Li, however, loved him and refused to acknowledge his inadequacies.\n\nIt so happened then that there was a monk, blind in one eye, who came to the city to solicit donations, and always knew what was going on in the privacy of people’s homes, so everyone was rather scared of him, like he was some kind of spirit; in addition, he asserted that he was able to control a person’s life or death, misfortune or happiness. He persisted in his seemingly limitless demands for money from the people, and no one dared to hold out on him.\n\nHe paid a visit to Li, hoping to collect a hundred strings of coins. Li was in no position to give him that much. He presented him with ten strings, but the monk refused them; eventually Li increased the amount to thirty. The monk gave him a severe look and said, “It has to be a hundred strings and not a jot less!” Li, equally furious, picked up the proffered strings of coins and left.\n\nThe monk abruptly stood up, exclaiming, “You’ll be sorry, you’ll be sorry!”\n\nNot long afterwards, Zhu’er experienced violent heart pains for no apparent reason, and began clawing at his mattress, looking as pale as dust and ashes. Frightened for him, Li took eighty strings of coins to the monk and begged him to save his son.\n\nLaughing, the monk declared, “It’s not easy to earn this kind of money! What could a mere hermit possibly do for you?”\n\nLi returned home and learned that his son had already died. He was profoundly grieved, so he filed a complaint with the county magistrate. The magistrate had the monk arrested and interrogated, accepting none of his impassioned pleas. The magistrate then called for him to be flogged, but it sounded like a drum was being beaten rather than a man. The magistrate ordered someone to search his body, where they found two wooden men, a small coffin, and five small flags. Outraged, the magistrate began repeating certain magical gestures with his hands. The monk then became frightened and knocked his head against the ground countless times in contrition. But the magistrate wouldn’t listen to him, and had him beaten to death. Li kowtowed his gratitude and returned home.\n\nSometime after sunset, Li and his wife were sitting on their bed. Suddenly a frightened-looking little boy rushed into the room and said, “Papa, why’d you go so fast? I tried my hardest, but couldn’t catch up with you.” Li examined his body and face, figuring him to be about seven or eight years old.\n\nShaken, Li was just about to ask him some questions when he looked over and found him there one moment but gone the next, suddenly turning to a smoky fog that wound and twisted around them, then rose and climbed up onto their bed. Li pushed him off and he fell to the floor without a sound.\n\nThe boy cried out, “Papa, what did you do that for!” He glanced shyly at Li, and then climbed back up. Li was frightened, as was his wife, so they both ran away. The boy cried for his papa and mama, moaning ceaselessly.\n\nLi led them into his wife’s room, hurriedly slamming the door shut; but when he turned around, the boy was suddenly there beside them. Shaken, Li asked him what he wanted. The boy replied, “I’m from Suzhou, and my name is Zhan. At the age of six I became an orphan, but my elder brother and his wife wouldn’t take me in, sending me instead to my maternal grandfather’s household.\n\n“Unexpectedly, while I was playing outside the gate there, a mad sorcerer killed me beneath the mulberry tree, turning me into a wandering ghost, unjustly barred from the underworld, unable to be reincarnated. It was my good fortune that you redressed that wrong, papa, so now I wish to stay here as your son.”\n\nLi told him, “People and ghosts must follow different paths, so how can we live together?”\n\nThe boy answered, “If you could allow me just a small room, to set up a bed and mattress, and each day prepare me a cup of cold congee, I wouldn’t need anything more.” Li agreed to this. The boy was jubilant and laid down to sleep in one of the other rooms.\n\nWhen morning arrived, he got up and walked into the family’s private quarters, just like he’d grown up in the house. He heard the sound of Li’s wife weeping and asked, “How many days has it been since Zhu’er died?” Li told him that it had been seven days. The boy declared, “Since the weather’s quite cold, his body won’t have decayed. Send someone out to open his grave and look inside, for if his body hasn’t been damaged, we should be able to bring him back to life.”\n\nLi was overjoyed, so he accompanied the boy, opened the grave, and examined the body, discovering it completely unchanged. Amazed by this, he turned to look at the boy, but found him nowhere in sight. Finding this strange, he lifted his son’s body and carried it home.\n\nJust as he was laying the body onto a bed, Zhu’er’s eyes opened, looking in Li’s direction, and less than a moment later he was calling for hot water—the hot water made him sweat, and after sweating it out, he was able to get up.\n\nEveryone was elated that Zhu’er had returned to life, and in addition he was clever and capable in ways curiously different than before. Yet at night he would lay there utterly stiff, not breathing in the least, and when they turned him over on his side, he didn’t move, just like he was dead. This frightened everyone, who said he must’ve died again; but at the crack of dawn, he began to stir like he was waking from a dream.\n\nThe household members drew near and asked him all about it. Zhu’er replied, “When I was with that sorcerer, there were two boys, one of whom was named Gezi. Yesterday, I couldn’t catch up with Papa because I was saying goodbye to Gezi. In the underworld, he’s now been adopted by Jiang Yuanwai, living a free and happy life. Last evening, he heartily invited me to play with him. Afterward, he sent me home on a yellow horse with a white nose and black mouth.”\n\nHis mother then asked him, “In the underworld, did you happen to see Zhu’er?”\n\nThe boy replied, “Zhu’er had already been reincarnated. He and papa were never fated to enjoy a father and son relationship. He was reincarnated into Yan Zifang of Jingling, who had come to collect a debt of a thousand and eight hundred coins.” In the past, Li had indeed done some trading in Jinling, and he’d owed money to a man named Yan, who had died, but no one else knew about the debt. When Li heard this, he was terribly startled.\n\nZhu’er’s mother asked him, “Did you see your elder sister?”\n\n“Nope,” the boy replied. “But I’ll go back and search for her.”\n\nTwo or three days later, he reported to his mother, “Happily, elder sister is quite content in the underworld, since she’s married to Chu Jiangwang, son of a minor official, and has pearls and jadeite aplenty to adorn her hair; whenever she goes out the door, there are always hoards of servants to announce her departure from the hall.”\n\nHis mother wondered, “Why doesn’t she come back to see her folks?”\n\n“When a person’s dead,” he explained, “she no longer has any bones or flesh, so there’s not much to be concerned about any longer. But if someone reminds her even a little of her former life, then she can be put back in touch with her old emotions. Yesterday, I asked Master Jiang if he would arrange for me to see elder sister, and she called for me to sit with her on a bed made from coral, where I told her that father and mother were very worried and concerned about her, which she took in like someone who was asleep.\n\n“So I said to her, ‘Elder sister, when you were alive, you took pleasure in embroidering stemmed flowers side-by-side—then one time, when you were trimming your fingernails with the scissors, some blood dripped onto the fine silk of your work, so you simply turned it into some reddish running water. Even now, mother has it hanging on the wall at the head of her bed so she can see it and always think of you. Sister, have you forgotten her?’\n\n“Sister was moved to tears and declared, ‘I have to explain to my husband, then I can return home to visit mama.’” His mother asked him when to expect her, and Zhu’er replied that he had no idea.\n\nOne day he suddenly told his mother, “Elder sister’s on her way with a large entourage of servants, so we’d better set out a generous supply of wine.” Shortly thereafter, he rushed back in to tell her, “Sister’s here!”\n\nHe moved a seat for her into the hall, saying, “Sister, please sit down and rest yourself, till you can stop your crying.” No one else who was there saw anything at all. Zhu’er directed the others to burn some hell money and offer libations of wine outside the gate, then returned and said, “I’ve commanded her escort to retire temporarily. Sister told me, ‘There used to be a green brocade quilt that already had a burnt spot in it the size of a pea—is it still around?’”\n\nZhu’er’s mother replied, “It’s still around.” At once she opened a basket and took out the quilt.\n\nThe boy reported, “Sister has requested her old bedroom. She’s exhausted and would like a little rest. Then tomorrow, mama, you can talk to her.”\n\nTheir neighbor to the east, named Zhao, had a daughter who used to embroider with Xiaohui. One night, she suddenly dreamt that Xiaohui, dressed in a scarf and purple robe, had come to visit with her, chatting and laughing like they always had before.\n\nAfter quite a while, Xiaohui said, “I am dead now, and though my father and mother are face-to-face with me, we might as well be far apart. Little sister, I’d like to borrow your body so I can speak with them; please don’t be alarmed.”\n\nWhen the next morning arrived, she was all ready to speak with her mother. Then she fell to the ground suddenly, unconscious. After she’d been in this state for about fifteen minutes, she started to come around, turned to her mother and said, “Auntie, while we’ve been apart for oh so many years, something has happened to make your hair turn white!”\n\nHer mother, astonished, wondered, “Are you insane, child?”\n\nThe daughter broke off her visit and left at once. Her mother, thinking this odd, followed her. Xiaohui made a beeline for the Li household and tearfully hugged her mother. Mrs. Li didn’t know what to think. Her daughter remarked, “When I came home yesterday, I was quite exhausted and couldn’t manage a single word. I’m not a filial daughter, to have left my parents behind, troubling my father and mother with grieving over me—what can I do to redeem such a crime!”\n\nHer mother, suddenly realizing what was going on, started crying. When she was able to stop, she inquired of her, “I’ve heard that you’re well off now, which certainly takes a load off my mind. But you’re living in a powerful household, so how were you able to leave and come here?”\n\nHer daughter replied, “My husband is extremely loving, and my in-laws are also very affectionate, so they said nothing against my coming.”\n\nNot long afterwards, Zhu’er ran in and reported, “Sister’s entourage is ready to depart.”\n\nXiaohui then stood up, bowed farewell while weeping, and said, “I must leave.” When she finished speaking, she fell down again, and for a time, the Zhao daughter remained motionless before reviving.\n\nAfter several months, Li became deathly ill and neither doctors nor medicines had any effect on him. Zhu’er cried, “I’m afraid that soon we won’t be able to save him! Two demons sit at the head of his bed, one holding an iron staff, the other a coil of hempen rope about 4 or 5 _chi_ long, but I’ve stayed day and night to ask them to leave, and they won’t listen to me.” Mrs. Li wept, then began to prepare her husband’s burial clothes.\n\nAt dusk, the boy hurried in and declared, “Everyone must leave, for sister’s husband has come to see papa.” Instantly he clapped his hands and laughed. His mother asked him why, and he replied, “I’m laughing at the two demons, who heard that sister’s husband had arrived and hid themselves under the bed like turtles.”\n\nShortly thereafter, he was staring into empty space when he began to exchange a few words of greeting, asking his sister about life at home. Then he clapped his hands and said, “Although the two lackey demons regrettably wouldn’t leave, it’s actually turned out to be a good thing!”\n\nThen he stepped outside the door, returning soon thereafter to announce, “Sister’s husband has just left. The two demons were chained up and strapped over his horse’s back. Papa should immediately get over his sickness. Sister’s husband told me that when he gets home, he’ll speak with the king and ask that both father and mother receive a hundred years of life.” The family was overjoyed. That night, Li’s illness was gone and in just a few days, he was completely healed.\n\nThey hired a tutor to teach the boy his lessons. Zhu’er proved to be very intelligent, and at the age of eighteen, he entered the county school, all the while still capable of discussing matters with denizens of the underworld. Whenever he saw anyone ill in his village, he’d always point out where there were demons and evil spirits in the place, apply moxibustion to clear them out, and thereby effect a cure.\n\nLater, however, he personally became violently ill, his skin turning black and blue, and he explained that he was being attacked by demons and spirits because he had revealed their presence—hence it was that he never spoke of them again.",

While he was laying down for a daytime nap in his study, there suddenly appeared a miniature honor guard, emerging from a corner of his room. The horses were only as large as frogs, and the people no bigger than fingers. The little troop included some ten squads; an official in a black silk cap, wearing a ceremonial gown, was riding in a sedan chair as droves of figures passed into the room and went out through the doorway.\n\nThe historian found this pretty strange, but figured since he’d been sleeping, it was all just his imagination. Suddenly he saw a little man reenter the room, carrying a stuffed cloth bag, the size of a fist. Eventually he made his way to the historian’s bed and set it down. Then he announced, “My master respectfully wishes to offer this modest gift to you, sir.”\n\nWhen he finished speaking, he stood facing the historian, but without delivering whatever was in the bag. After a bit, the little man laughed and said, “I imagine a historian wouldn’t have any use for such a tiny, tiny thing, so it’d probably be better to give it to me.”\n\nThe historian nodded his approval. Joyfully, the little man picked up the bag and departed. It’s a pity that in his shock, the historian didn’t think to ask where the little man was from."

        "body": "Scholar Shang lived in Taishan. He spent his time alone in the quiet of his study. One autumn evening, with the Milky Way twinkling from on high and the moon shining bright in the sky, Shang was pacing back and forth through some moonlit flowers, indulging himself with a beauty in his imagination.\n\nSuddenly a young lady emerged from the other side of the wall, and with a smile, asked, “What could a _xiucai_ be thinking about so deeply?”\n\nShang came over for a closer look, and found she had the stunning beauty of a goddess. Pleasantly surprised, he embraced her and led her inside, where they immediately became very intimate. She told him, “My name is Hu, Third Sister Hu.” When he asked her where she lived, she merely smiled and said nothing. Shang didn’t repeat his question, wishing nothing more than for them to be together always, in love. From that time forward, there were no more empty evenings for him.\n\nOne night, while he sat beside her, chatting under the lamplight, Shang became so obsessed with her that he couldn’t stop staring at her. Third sister laughed and said, “Why are you staring at me like that?”\n\nHe replied, “I’m looking at my darling, who’s like the red peony and the peach blossom, and I could gaze like this all night long and never grow tired of it.”\n\nThird Sister remarked, “I’m homely and simple, yet you’re so taken with me; if you were to see my family’s Fourth Sister, you’d really stare.” Shang became even more aroused, expressing his regret that he hadn’t yet seen her face, and knelt in sincerity for a long time, abjectly begging for the opportunity.\n\nThe next evening, consequently, she brought Fourth Sister to meet him. She was only about fifteen, a pink lotus dripping with morning dew, an apricot blossom moistened by morning mists, with a captivating smile on her lips—the fascinating beauty was peerless. Shang, wildly happy, led them to sit down. Third Sister shared laughter and chit-chat with him; Fourth Sister simply played with her embroidered sash, her head bowed and silent.\n\nA bit later, Third Sister stood up to leave, and her sister wanted to follow her out. Shang grabbed her and wouldn’t let go, turned to Third Sister and said, “Sweetie, please help me out by saying something.”\n\nThird Sister then laughed and said, “This crazy fellow’s so impatiently passionate! Sister, you’d better stick around for a little while.” Fourth Sister said nothing, so her elder sister departed.\n\nShang and Fourth Sister proceeded to make love exuberantly, till afterwards Fourth Sister stretched out her arm for Shang to lie upon, and she began honestly to disclose everything about herself, without holding anything back. Fourth Sister explained to him that she was a fox. Shang had become so attracted to her beauty that he didn’t find this at all strange.\n\nHence, Fourth Sister revealed, “Third Sister is ruthlessly cruel, and has already killed three people. No one misled by her will can avoid dying. It’s my good fortune to be the object of your love, and I couldn’t bear to see you die, so you must stop all contact with her as soon as possible.” Shang was fearful, and pleaded with her to help him out. Fourth Sister explained, “Though I am a fox, I was taught the secrets of the celestials, so I’ll make a talisman for you to paste up on your chamber door, and it can keep her away.” Then she copied down the talisman.\n\nAt dawn, Third Sister arrived, saw the talisman and drew back, crying, “The girl has lost all loyalty, falling all over herself for her new lord without recalling who served as her matchmaker. You two may be meant to be together, but I’ve never opposed that, so why’re you acting like this?” Then straightaway she left.\n\nA few days later, Fourth Sister found Shang and made arrangements to see him the following night. That day, Shang unexpectedly went outside to enjoy the view, and at the foot of a hill where there was a stand of trees, from out of the mist, there emerged a young woman who was also quite charming. She approached Shang and said, “_Xiucai_, why are you so lovesick over those Hu sisters all the time? They can’t even offer you a single string of cash as a present.”\n\nAt once she gave him a string of coins, advising him, “Take this right home and buy some nice wine; I’ll bring some little tidbits along directly and we can have some fun.” Shang took the money and went home, doing just as he’d been instructed.\n\nA little later, the young woman showed up, laid a roast chicken and a shoulder of salt pork on the table, took out a small knife, and deftly cut the meat into thin slices; then they poured the wine and began teasing each other, chatting with giddy gleefulness. Afterwards they extinguished the candles, went to bed, and made passionate love.\n\nThe sun was already up by the time they rose. They were sitting at the end of the bed, playing with each other’s feet and exchanging their slippers, when suddenly they heard someone’s voice; they were listening closely when the Hu sisters entered through the curtains. When the young woman saw them, she panicked and fled, leaving her slippers behind on the bed.\n\nThe two sisters followed after her, shouting, “Fox bitch! How dare you sleep with this man!” They chased her out, and were gone for some time before returning.\n\nFourth Sister berated Shang: “You’re not scoring many points, getting together with that fox bitch, so don’t try to snuggle up to us again!” In a huff, she prepared to leave. Aghast, Shang flung himself to the ground and begged her forgiveness with penitent words. With Third Sister working on the other side to explain and to dismiss his actions, Fourth Sister’s anger began to abate somewhat, and hence the two of them were reconciled.\n\nOne day, a Shaanxi man, riding a donkey, came up to Shang’s gate and said, “I’ve been searching for this evil thing day and night, and now I’ve finally caught up with her.” Shang’s father found his words odd, and inquired where the man had come from. He replied, “I’ve been traveling on the lakes daily, combing all four directions for ten years and some months, often away from my home for eight and nine months at a time. That’s why this evil thing had the chance to kill my younger brother.\n\n“At home, profoundly sad, I swore an oath to find and exterminate her. Pursuing her for several thousand _li_, I could find no sign of her. Now she’s in your home. If she’s not destroyed, others like my brother will die.”\n\nThough Shang had tried to keep his intimacy with the women a secret, his father and mother had begun to suspect the situation, so when they heard the visitor’s words and found themselves greatly afraid, they encouraged him to come in and try his magical solution.\n\nHe pulled out two bottles, lined them up on the ground, then worked on talismans and incantations for a good long time. Four columns of black fog materialized, then were sucked inside the bottles. The visitor joyfully exclaimed, “That’s the entire family.” Then he stuffed pig’s bladder into the mouths of the bottles, sealing them airtight. Shang’s father was very happy, and eagerly encouraged the guest to stay for dinner.\n\nShang, however, felt pity, and drew near the bottles to steal a glance, where he heard Fourth Sister say from inside one of them, “You sit there and watch us without coming to our rescue—don’t you have any feelings?”\n\nShang was stung by her words. He anxiously tried to remove the bladder, but couldn’t untie the knot holding it in place. Fourth Sister called again, “Don’t bother; just lay the charms down, then poke a needle into the bladder and I’ll come out at once.” Shang did as she requested. The result was a thread of white fog that came out through the needle hole, rose up into the sky and vanished.\n\nWhen the guest from Shaanxi came out, he saw the charms lying flat on the ground, and, greatly alarmed, cried, “She’s escaped! It has to be the young master who did this.” He shooked the bottles and inclined his head to listen to them, then said, “Fortunately, only one of them got away. That one apparently wasn’t meant to die, so she can be forgiven.” Then he took the bottles that were still sealed and departed.\n\nQuite some time afterwards, Shang was out in the fields, supervising his servants as they were harvesting wheat, when in the distance he spotted Fourth Sister sitting under a tree. He came over to her, taking her hand, and expressed how worried he’d been about her.\n\nShe explained, “Ten springs and autumns have passed, and now I’ve succeeded in producing my immortality pill. Yet I can’t get you out of my mind, so I’ve come back to pay my respects and find out how you are.” Shang wanted to take her back home. She replied, “I’m no longer the individual I used to be, so I can’t allow myself to develop feelings for this mortal world, but we will see each other again some day.” Once her words were finished, she disappeared.\n\nAnother twenty years passed, and Shang was alone at home when he saw Fourth Sister come in from outside. Jubilant, Shang tried to speak to her. She interrupted to declare, “I’ve now become one of the celestials, and shouldn’t have returned to walk this mortal world. But moved by your thoughtfulness to me, I’ve respectfully come to announce when you will die. You can settle all of your affairs ahead of time; don’t be sad, I’ll help you pass on to become an immortal spirit, so you won’t suffer.” Then she took her leave and left him.\n\nWhen the day she’d named arrived, Shang did, indeed, die. Shang was a relative of my friend, Li Wanyu, who actually saw him in person.",

For that reason, I’ve come to take you along on my journey.” Everyone attributed his words’ strangeness to the fact that he’d just revived, and hence didn’t take them seriously.\n\nZhu repeated his words to her. His wife replied, “Such sentiments are very nice. But you’ve just come back to life, so how can you think about dying?”\n\nZhu waved his hands and insisted, “It’s not difficult. Please finish arranging your affairs quickly, and come with me.”\n\nHis wife laughed and made no move to leave. Zhu pressed her again. She didn’t want to go against his wishes, so she walked out the door and reentered about fifteen minutes later, trying to fool him by remarking, “I’ve taken care of settling everything.” Zhu ordered her to hurry up and put on her make-up. His wife didn’t react, so he urged her even more anxiously. She couldn’t bear to deny him what he wished, so she put on a skirt and some make-up, and then came out.\n\nThe younger members of the family tried to conceal their giggling. Zhu laid his head on his pillow and clapped his hands for his wife to join him. “That’s completely weird,” his wife said, “having us lay together like a pair of corpses—is that what you want our young relatives to see?”\n\nZhu beat the bed with his fists and cried, “How can you find death something to laugh about!” The younger family members saw that Zhu was quite impatient, so together they encouraged their auntie to go along with what he wanted. Zhu’s wife did as she was told, and laid stiffly next to him. The family members once again began snickering among themselves.\n\nShortly afterward, they observed that the wife was no longer grinning, and gradually had closed both of her eyes, and for a long time there was no sound, just as though she’d fallen asleep. When the others drew close to take a look, they found her skin cold as ice, and determined she wasn’t breathing. They also examined Zhu, who was in the same condition, and then realized the horrible truth.\n\nThis happened in the twenty-first year of the reign of Kangxi, and the wife of Zhu’s younger brother, who was working in the household of an official named Bi, told me all she knew about it.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Maybe old man Zhu had always behaved strangely. The road to the underworld is vast, so how rare it is for him to leave, and then to come back like that! Though that white-haired head wanted the two of them to leave, even shouting and finally demanding that they leave, what unhurried restraint he showed! When a person is going to die, the hardest thing to endure is saying goodbye to one’s dearest companion. If we can spread old man Zhu’s magic, when it comes time for us to die, we won’t need to make arrangements for our family in advance.”",

In the eastern corner of the Hell King’s palace, a number of scaffolds had been set up, and hanging from each were the skins of pigs, sheep, dogs, and horses.\n\nThe Minister of the Registry called out his name, announcing that as his punishment he would be made something like a horse or a pig; then the people there were all stripped entirely bare to be hung up, seized, and skinned.\n\nAfter a while, it was the scholar’s turn, and the Hell King declared, “This man should be made a sheep.” Demons grabbed hold of a white sheepskin and spread it over the man’s body.\n\n“He once saved a person from dying,” the Minister cried out.\n\nThe Hell King checked his register, scouring it carefully, then commanded, “Let him go free.

        "body": "Scholar Gu lived in Jinling. Despite his being rich in talent and skills, his family was quite poor. Since his mother was aged and he couldn’t bear to leave her behind to make his fortune, he devoted his days to producing calligraphy and paintings for people, using what he received in exchange to care for his mother. At the age of twenty-five, he still had not married.\n\nAcross from their house was a residence that had long been empty, until an old woman and a girl moved in to rent it. Since it was apparent that there were no men in the family, Gu didn’t ask them who they were.\n\nOne day, as he was coming in from outdoors, he noticed the girl, who appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen, emerging from his mother’s room, elegantly beautiful and utterly refined, a rare combination indeed; she made a big detour to avoid Gu when she saw him, though she seemed quite brave and serious at the same time.\n\nHe went to ask his mother about her. She explained, “She’s the young lady from the family across the way, who came to borrow my scissors and tapeline. She explained that she, too, has only her mother for family. This girl isn’t the product of some poor family. I asked her why she isn’t married, and she replied that her mother’s too elderly for her to leave her. Tomorrow I should pay my respects to her mother and observe what she thinks; if her hopes for the girl aren’t too extravagant, you could marry her and take over supporting her mother.”\n\nThe next day, Gu’s mother paid a visit to their home, discovering that the old woman was virtually deaf. She looked around the house and found that there wasn’t any food left over from the previous night. She asked what they did for a living, and the old woman replied that she depended upon the sewing work of her daughter’s ten fingers.\n\nWhen Gu’s mother had a dinner with the mother and daughter, she eventually proposed her plan for their families’ coming together. The old woman seemed willing to accept it, but then she turned to consult her daughter; the girl was speechless, but seemed displeased nonetheless. Gu’s mother then returned home.\n\nShe gave Gu the details of what had transpired and wondered aloud, “Is the girl worried that we’re too poor? She neither speaks or smiles, she’s as beautiful as peach and plum blossoms but as cold as ice—what an odd person!” The mother and son speculated and sighed, then let the matter drop.\n\nOne day, as Gu was sitting in his studio, a young man arrived and requested a painting from him. The fellow was extremely good-looking, and rather irreverent. When asked where he was from, the young man responded, “A nearby village.” He subsequently visited Gu every two or three days.\n\nOver time, they became better acquainted, and gradually began to tease each other; Gu lasciviously embraced the young man, who put up no resistance, and they indulged in sexual pleasures. Hence their contact became intimate indeed.\n\nOnce when they ran into the girl, who was passing by, the young man followed her with his eyes and asked who she was. Gu answered, “The neighbor girl.”\n\nThe young man commented, “As gorgeous as all that, why’s she look so unapproachable?”\n\nAfter a little while, Gu went inside. His mother informed him, “That girl just came over to borrow some rice, and admitted that they haven’t built a cooking fire for a day or so. This girl is very filial, but so poor that one has to sympathize, so it’s only proper that we show a little compassion.”\n\nGu obeyed his mother’s words, carrying a _dou_ of rice on his back to the neighbors’ door and delivering his mother’s sentiments. The girl accepted the rice, but without expressing any thanks.\n\nHenceforth, she often visited Gu’s home, and when she saw his mother making clothing or shoes, she would take her place and do the sewing; she went in and out of their rooms, doing the manual labor of a wife. Gu grew progressively more appreciative of her. Any time someone brought him some cakes or dainties as a present, he made sure to give some to her mother, though the girl also failed to acknowledge this.\n\nGu’s mother subsequently developed an ulcerous sore near her genitals that caused her to cry out in pain all through the night. The girl came to the old lady’s bedside at every opportunity to look in on her, washing her sore clean, and applying medicine to it three or four times a day. Gu’s mother didn’t feel right about this, but the girl was not in the least put off by the putrescence.\n\n“Ah me,” sighed Gu’s mother, “how can I find a young woman like you for my son, to care for me till I die!” After speaking these words, she began to sob, choked with emotion.\n\nThe girl comforted her, asserting, “Your son is extremely filial, which is ten, even a hundred times better than being like us, a widowed mother and her lone daughter.”\n\n“But how can even a filial son remain on call by my bedside like a servant?” Gu’s mother wondered. “Besides, this body is moving towards its end, and in a short while I shall die of an illness, so I’m deeply troubled that our ancestral line may not be continued.”\n\nWhile she was speaking, Gu walked in. Weeping, his mother said to him, “Your mama owes this young woman a great deal, so you must not forget to repay her kindnesses.” Gu immediately prostrated himself to signify his gratitude.\n\nThe girl declared, “You showed compassion for my mother, yet I did not thank you; so why should you thank me now?” At this, Gu became even more respectful and fond of her. She, on the other hand, continued her distant behavior, having nothing in the least to do with him.\n\nOne day, as the girl walked out through their gate, Gu found his eyes glued to her. Suddenly she turned her head and smiled at him seductively. Gu, rapturously happy at this unexpected turn of events, hurried to follow her into her house. He began caressing her, and she didn’t resist, so they joyfully made love.\n\nWhen they were finished, the girl warned Gu, “This was a one-time affair—it can never happen again!” Gu gave no reply and returned home.\n\nThe next day, he tried to arrange another rendezvous with her. With a severe expression on her face, the girl refused to look at him and left. When she appeared each day and Gu encountered her, she refused to respond, verbally or facially. Even his slightest effort at teasing her was met with cold words that chilled him.\n\nOnce, when they were alone, she suddenly asked him, “Who is that young man who comes here every day?” Gu answered her. She replied, “His manner is insulting, and his behavior toward me is always impertinent. Since he’s your intimate companion, I’ve let the matter lie. Please be sure to give him this message: unless he wants to die, he’d better not act like that again!”\n\nWhen night came, Gu gave the young man her message, and insisted, “You’ve got to be careful, she’s not someone to mess with!”\n\nThe young man retorted, “Since she’s not to be messed with, what’ve you two been doing in private?” Gu quickly denied having done anything. The young man demanded, “If you haven’t been involved with her, then how did those filthy insults manage to reach your hearing?” Gu found himself unable to respond.\n\n“I’ll trouble you,” the young man said, “to tell her this: stop the pretentious posing; otherwise, I’ll spread the story everywhere.” Gu was furious, his anger reflected as his face flushed, so the young man went away.\n\nOne night, while Gu was sitting by himself, the girl suddenly came in, smiling, and said, “My relationship with you apparently isn’t fated to end just yet, so it must be heaven’s doing.” Insanely happy, he clasped her tightly in his arms.\n\nSuddenly they heard the sound of footsteps noisily approaching, so the startled pair sat up just as the young man pushed the door open and burst in. Gu, shaken, demanded, “What are you doing here?”\n\nLaughing, the young man replied, “I’ve come to see what a virtuous, chaste person looks like.” He turned to the girl and sneered, “What, no rebukes for me today?”\n\nThe girl’s eyebrows shot up and her cheeks reddened, but she remained silent, uttering not a word. She quickly rummaged inside her clothing and brought out a leather bag, then withdrew a long, glittering, translucent blade. When the young man saw it, he turned and ran.\n\nThe girl chased him out the door, but when she looked around for him, he was gone. When she then cast her blade up into the air, there was a piercingly sharp sound as it sailed in a luminous arc, till suddenly something fell to the ground with a thud. Gu anxiously brought a candle over, and was astonished to discover a white fox, its body and head sliced asunder.\n\n“This is your boyfriend,” explained the girl. “I had genuinely forgiven him, but there was no alternative since he just didn’t want to live any longer!” She then retrieved her sword and placed it in her bag. Gu tried to draw her back inside. She replied, “That evil spirit has spoiled the mood, so if you please, I’ll come another night.” She went out the door and in no time was gone.\n\nThe next evening, the girl did indeed return to him, so they lay together, twined in perfect harmony. When he asked her about her swordcraft, she answered, “This is not something for you to know. Indeed, you must keep this a secret, for revealing it, I fear, would bring you misfortune.”\n\nGu then proposed marriage, to which she replied, “I’ve been to bed with you, I’ve carried water for you—if that’s not being a wife, what is it? Since we’re already husband and wife, what’s the point of talking about marriage?”\n\n“Is it because you despise my being poor?” Gu asked.\n\n“Of course you’re poor,” she responded, “but am I wealthy? I’m staying with you tonight precisely because I sympathize with your being poor.” When it came time for her to leave, she advised him, “These indiscretions of ours cannot continue. When it’s right for me to come, I will come; when it’s not, even the strongest coercion won’t succeed.”\n\nThereafter, whenever they ran into each other, Gu always wanted to lead the girl somewhere to talk privately, but she would simply walk the other way, avoiding him. Nevertheless, she tended to clothes that needed mending, collected the fuel for cooking fires, and set everything in order, no differently than a wife would do.\n\nSeveral months later, her mother died, and Gu spent everything he could muster to bury her properly. The girl thereafter lived alone in her house. Gu thought that since she was by herself, he might be able to sleep with her again, so he climbed over the wall and called repeatedly outside her window, but she gave no response.\n\nThen he looked over at her gate, and noticed that while the house was empty, the gate was bolted shut. He began to suspect that the girl had someone else there with her. When he returned the next night, things were just the same. So he left a jade pendant on her window sill and went home.\n\nThe following day, he met her in his mother’s room. As soon as they stepped outside it, the girl, trailing behind him, asked, “Do you suspect me of something? Each person keeps certain things in the heart that are not for others to know. Although I don’t want you to be suspicious, I have nothing to tell you. But there _is_ a troubling matter that I’m anxious to have you settle for me.”\n\nHe asked what it was and she explained, “I’m eight months pregnant, and worry that I may give birth at any time. Since ‘my body isn’t clearly my own,’ I can bear you a child, but I can’t nurse it for you. You can confide this to your mother, so she can search for a wet nurse and act as though you’re adopting the child, but don’t say anything about me.” Gu promised, and then told his mother.\n\nShe laughed and said, “What a strange girl! She rejects my son’s proposal of marriage but then conducts a secret affair with him.” She happily followed the girl’s plan to see what would happen.\n\nAfter more than a month passed, the girl suddenly didn’t show up for several days. Gu’s mother became concerned, and went to her gate to find out why. Dreary and lonely, the house was locked up and still. She knocked for a very long time, till the girl finally came out, her hair disheveled and her face dirty. She opened the door to Gu’s mother, then shut it after her.\n\nOnce inside the girl’s room, she discovered a crying infant lying on the bed. Shocked, Gu’s mother asked, “How long has it been since you gave birth?”\n\n“Three days,” replied the girl.\n\nGu’s mother picked up the baby and examined it, determining it to be a boy; furthermore, he had plump cheeks and a broad forehead. Delighted, she exclaimed, “You’ve given birth to a grandson for me, but now you’ll be left alone, so what will you do for support?”\n\nThe girl answered, “I dare not reveal the trivial secrets of my heart to you, mother. Wait until evening, when no one’s around, then you can take the child and go.” Gu’s mother went home and informed her son, both of them finding the girl’s response quite odd. That night, they went to pick up the baby, and brought it home.\n\nSeveral nights later, at about midnight, the girl suddenly appeared at the door and came in, carrying a leather bag in her hand, announcing with a smile, “I’ve concluded a great mission, so please allow me to take my leave now.” Gu anxiously inquired her reason for leaving, and she replied, “I’ll never fail to remember your kindness in helping my mother. When I told you ‘this was a one-time affair—it can never happen again,’ it was to suggest that I wasn’t trying to recompense you in the privacy of bed. Because you’re poor and cannot afford to marry, I’ve helped you to continue your family line. I’d hoped we’d succeed with one attempt, but unexpectedly, my period came as usual, so I had to break my oath and try again. Now that your kindness has been repaid and I have carried out my intentions, I have no more regrets.”\n\n“What’s in your bag?” Gu asked.\n\nShe replied, “It’s my enemy’s head.” Gu examined the bag and then peered inside it, turning the head over to find its facial hair matted with blood, its face unrecognizable. Horrified by it, he returned to his questions for an accounting.\n\n“All along, I didn’t tell you everything,” she explained, “since I couldn’t reveal the details to you, for fear that you might divulge them. Now that the business has been successfully concluded, there’s no harm in telling you: I’m from Zhejiang. My father was a Sima, falsely condemned to death by an enemy who also confiscated our family’s holdings. I carried my mother away on my back, concealed our family name, covered my face, and disappeared for the last three years.\n\n“Hence I didn’t pursue my revenge immediately, because I still had my mother to think about; once mother was gone, there was that lump of flesh in my belly, and for those reasons I had to delay for so long. On the nights when I wasn’t in my house, I’d gone out to find my enemy’s home, since I was unfamiliar with the roads, and feared that I might miss him.”\n\nOnce she finished speaking, she went out the door. As she did, she admonished him, “Be kind, and watch out for the child I bore. Your good fortune is slight, and you won’t live long, but this child will achieve glory for your family. It’s late at night, so don’t awaken mother—I’ve got to go!” Before he could sadly inquire about her destination, she vanished in a flash like lightning, so that in the time it took to glance at her, she was no longer to be seen. Gu could do nothing but sigh and stand there numbly, as though he’d lost his very soul.\n\nThe next day he told his mother everything, considering with her the strangeness of it all, and that was an end of the matter. After three years, Gu really did die. His son, at eighteen, qualified as a _jinshi_, and they say that he respectfully cared for his grandmother until she died.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “A man has to have a wife like the swordswoman if he wants to keep a boyfriend as livestock. Otherwise while you’re loving your handsome boar, he’ll be loving your breeder pig!”",

        "body": "Scholar Che’s family was not well fixed for money, but he was addicted to drinking. When night fell, unless he helped himself to three cups of wine, he couldn’t get to sleep, and for that reason he never allowed the wine bottle by his bedside to become empty.\n\nOne night he woke up, and as he turned over, he sensed that there was someone lying in the bed with him, so he figured that the bedclothes he’d used to cover himself must have slid off into a pile. He felt around till he found something soft and fluffy, like a cat, but larger; he brought a candle over—and there was a fox, dead drunk, and sleeping it off. He looked over at his wine bottle and found it empty.\n\nHence he laughed, and said, “This’ll be my drinking buddy.” Not wishing to rouse the fox, he tucked it in and laid his arm over it, so they could sleep next to each other. He kept the light burning, so he could observe the fox if it changed into something else.\n\nAt midnight, the fox yawned and stretched itself. Che chuckled, and declared, “You’ve had such a nice nap!” When he lifted up the bedclothes and looked beneath them, there wearing a Confucian scholar’s cap was a handsome young man.\n\nHe got up from the bed and did obeisance to Che, thanking him for his kindness in not killing him. Che replied, “I’m always into the liquor, so people take me for a fool; pal, you’ll be a Bao Shu to me. If you have no misgivings about the proposition, I’d like for you to be my drinking buddy.” He pulled the fox back down onto the bed, and again lay down to sleep, adding, “If you can visit often, don’t hesitate for any reason.” The fox agreed to return. When Che next woke up, the fox had already gone. He then acquired a good quantity of excellent wine and waited for the fox.\n\nWhen night came, the fox did return and they happily drank together in private. The fox was a prodigious drinker, and its words were so humorous that Che was sorry they hadn’t met sooner. The fox said, “I’ve enjoyed your fine wine repeatedly, so what can I do to repay your kindness?”\n\nChe replied, “That piddling amount of wine is hardly worth mentioning!”\n\n“Be that as it may,” persisted the fox, “you’re a poor scholar, and it’s not easy for you to get money for drinks. Therefore I’d like to devise a modest plan for you to come up with drinking money.”\n\nThe next night, the fox showed up and announced, “If you go seven _li_ southeast of here, by the side of the road there’s some gold that’s been left behind, and you can go there to collect it.”\n\nChe went there as he was told, found two pieces of gold, then bought some delicacies at the market to go with their wine that night. The fox responded by informing him, “Behind your courtyard, stored in a cellar there, is something you should check out.”\n\nChe did as it said, and so discovered more than a hundred strings of cash. Delighted, he declared, “With this in the bag, I have no more worries about buying wine.”\n\n“Not so,” replied the fox. “When water fills the rut left by a passing wheel, can it last for long? We need to plan for even more.”\n\nAnother day, the fox called on Che, and told him, “The market price for buckwheat is very low now, and this business opportunity will set you up.” Che followed this advice, buying up over forty _dan_ of buckwheat. Everyone laughed at him for doing so.\n\nIt wasn’t long before a great drought dried up and withered all the grain and vegetables, until only buckwheat could still grow; Che sold his buckwheat for a tenfold profit. Thanks to the transaction, he became a rich man, and acquired two hundred _mu_ of irrigated farmland.\n\nHe still asked the fox for advice, and when it told him to sow lots of wheat, he did, and reaped accordingly, and when it advised sowing lots of millet, he did, and reaped in kind—the appropriate species and planting times were always as selected by the fox.\n\nOver time they grew even closer, the fox calling Che’s wife his sister-in-law and treating Che’s son like his own. But after Che died, the fox never came back.",

Sang peeked out to ask who was there, and the woman replied she was a ghost. Sang was so terrified that his teeth chattered noisily. The prostitute backed away and left.\n\nIn the morning, the neighbor came over to Sang’s study, so he described what he’d seen, and announced his intention of returning to his hometown. The neighbor clapped his hands and said, “Why didn’t you open your door and invite her in?” Sang paused and realized that he’d been tricked, so he returned to living placidly as he had before.\n\nHalf a year went by, then a girl came one evening and knocked at his study’s door. Sang figured his friend was fooling with him again, so he opened the door and invited her to enter, discovering her to be a devastatingly gorgeous girl. Amazed, he asked her where she’d come from, and she answered, “I’m Lian Xiang, a prostitute from a brothel just west of here.”\n\nSince he knew there were several brothels in that vicinity, he believed her. They extinguished the lights, climbed into bed, and wove themselves together like exquisite silk. From then on, she dropped by regularly every few nights.\n\nOne evening, Sang was sitting alone with his thoughts, when a girl entered quietly. He figured it was Lian and got up to greet her. When he saw her face, he realized his mistake: she was only about fifteen or sixteen years old, wore expansive sleeves and an unmarried girl’s hairstyle which hung down her foreheard, yet she looked sophisticated and beautiful, walking into the room with steps that seemed to be both coming and going. Greatly startled, Sang suspected that she was a fox.\n\nThe girl declared, “I’m from a good family, by the name of Li. Admiring your refinement, it’s my good luck to be able to make your acquaintance.” Sang was quite flattered.\n\nHe took her by the hand, which was cold as ice, and asked, “Why are your hands so chilly?”\n\n“All my life, my body’s been too weak to be very warm,” Li replied, “besides, being out in the evening’s frost and dew, how can my hands be warm!” Then she loosened her silk robe, and Sang believed she truly was a virgin. She told him, “Because I love you, I want to offer myself to you this evening. If you don’t think it too low of me, I hope to take care of your needs often while next to you on your pillow and mat. Do you have anyone else seeing you?”\n\n“No one except a nearby prostitute,” Sang replied, “but she doesn’t attend to me very often.”\n\nLi said, “I’ll be careful to avoid her. I’m not one of those kinds of people, so you mustn’t reveal our secret to her. When she comes, I’ll go, and when she goes, I’ll come whenever I can.” Just as the rooster was about to crow, she offered Sang an embroidered slipper as a present, declaring, “I’ve worn this on my foot, so just touch it whenever you yearn for me. However, if anyone’s around, you must be careful not to bring it out!”\n\nHe took the slipper, examining it carefully, noting it was so tiny that it came to a point at the end, like an awl. He loved her for it. The following evening, when no one was around, he took out the slipper and began playing with it. Li gracefully appeared all of a sudden, and the two joined together intimately. Henceforth, every time he took out the slipper, the girl would inevitably show up, as if she could sense his thoughts.\n\nIt seemed pretty odd, so he asked her about it. She laughed, “It’s just a coincidence.”\n\nOne night, Lian arrived, and became terribly shocked, asking Sang, “Why do you look so washed out?”\n\n“I can’t feel anything wrong,” he replied. Lian then bid him farewell, making a date that they would meet again in ten days.\n\nAfter she left, Li came to him without missing an evening. “Why’s it been so long since your lover’s shown up here?” she asked him. When he told her about the appointment she’d made with him, Li laughed and inquired, “Who do you find the more beautiful, Lian Xiang or me?”\n\nSang replied, “The two of you are matchless. But Lian’s flesh is warmer.”\n\nLi’s facial expression changed, and she declared, “You claim our beauty is equal, but you’re only saying that in my presence. She must be another goddess of the Moon Palace, so I’m clearly no match for her.” Hence she was no longer cheerful. Then she counted on her fingers that ten days had just elapsed, so warning Sang not to give her away, she planned to spy on Lian.\n\nThe next night, after Lian Xiang arrived, they laughed and chatted together in perfect harmony. When they made ready to go to bed, Lian, quite startled, cried, “How awful! I haven’t seen you in ten days, so what could have done you so much harm? Can you swear you haven’t been meeting with someone else?” Sang asked her why she was wondering. “I can see it in your expression,” she explained, “and your pulse is whispy, like unraveled silk—you have the ghost disease.”\n\nThe following night, when Li appeared, Sang asked, “Did you get a peek at Lian Xiang?”\n\n“She’s a beauty, alright,” she replied. “I’m sure there’s no one else so lovely in the whole world—she must be a fox. When she left, I followed her to her den in the southern hills.” Sang suspected this was just a matter of jealousy, and casually dismissed it.\n\nThe next evening, he teased Lian Xiang, “While I put no credence in it, there are some who say you’re a fox.”\n\n“Who’s been saying this to you?” Lian anxiously asked.\n\nSang smiled and said, “It’s just my own notion, darling.”\n\nLian then asked, “What is the difference between a fox and a human?”\n\n“Foxes seduce people and make them sick, and the sickness can grow serious enough to make people die, which is why they’re feared,” he explained.\n\nLian Xiang exclaimed, “That’s not true. For someone as young as you, the vitality can return in just three days, so how can sex with a fox prove harmful to you? Doing it daily, however, would curtail your vitality, so in that way the person choosing to do so would be doing more harm than the fox. Are you saying that foxes are to blame for everyone who dies of consumption? That’s why I believe someone’s been saying things about me.”\n\nThough Sang vigorously asserted that nothing had been said against her, Lian kept questioning him earnestly. He couldn’t stand to keep it from her, so he told her everything.\n\nLian replied, “No wonder I could tell you’d become fatigued recently. But what could’ve caused this to happen so quickly? Is it because she’s not human? You must say nothing about it, and tomorrow night I’ll do as she did and spy on her.”\n\nWhen night came, Li appeared, and hadn’t spoken three words when she heard the sound of a cough outside the window, then swiftly ran off. Lian entered and cried, “You’re doomed! She’s truly a ghost! If you continue to fall prey to her beauty and don’t break with her immediately, you’re heading straight for the underworld!”\n\nSang thought she was simply jealous, and refused to comment.\n\nLian remarked, “It’s clear that you’re not going to give up your feelings for her, but I just can’t bear to see you die. Tomorrow, I’ll bring some medicine for you to dispel your fatal disease. With any luck, the disease has taken only shallow root in you, and in ten days you should be cured. Please stay in bed with me and I’ll watch over you, so we can make you well.”\n\nThe next night, she took out a measure of medicine, and Sang swallowed it down. Instantly, it circulated throughout his innards, till his guts felt clear and calm, and his spirit immediately brightened. Although he was grateful to Lian Xiang, in the end he still wouldn’t believe that Li was a ghost.\n\nNight after night, Lian Xiang stayed under the quilt, and snuggled close to Sang; but if he started to get amorous, she’d always turn away. After several days, his flesh filled out again. Before she left, Lian sincerely urged him to stop seeing Li. Sang disingenuously agreed he would do so.\n\nBut as soon as he’d closed the door, he turned up the wick of his lamp, took out Li’s slipper, laid down and began lusting for her. Li suddenly appeared.\n\nBecause quite a number of days had gone by since they’d seen each other, she gave him a very resentful look. Sang explained, “She stayed with me these nights to work some medical magic, so please don’t be angry—I have genuine feelings for you.” Li was somewhat placated by this.\n\nSang laid down with her, and in a bedroom confidence told her, “I care for you very much, but there are some who say you’re a ghost.”\n\nLi was at a loss for words for quite some time, then shrieked, “You must have been listening to the lies of that fucking fox! If you don’t stop seeing her, I’m not coming back!” Then she began sobbing and weeping. Sang tried everything he could think of to console her, till she finally calmed down.\n\nA night later, Lian Xiang arrived and could tell that Li had been back, angrily declaring, “You certainly want to die!”\n\nSang laughed, “Why are you so deeply jealous of her?”\n\nLian became even more furious: “You were cultivating your own death till I stopped you, and if I hadn’t been jealous, what would’ve become of you?”\n\nSang made excuses, then jokingly said, “She told me yesterday that my sickness was the work of a fox spirit.”\n\nLian sighed, then responded, “It’s clear from your words that you don’t realize how mistaken you are, which I hadn’t expected, but even with a hundred mouths, how could I justify myself to you? Now I must ask to part with you. One hundred days from now, I will see you lying in your bed.” He couldn’t convince her to stay, so with a look of disappointment, she went away directly. From this time forward, Li was together with him every night.\n\nAbout two months went by, and he began to feel exhausted. At first he just tried to console himself; but as the days passed, he gradually became exceedingly thin, and couldn’t take in more than a single bowl of congee. He wanted to return to his hometown, where he could be supported and cared for while recovering, yet he was so passionately attached to Li that he just couldn’t bear to rush off.\n\nSince he decided to stay, in a few days the effects became so severe that he was unable to get out of bed. His neighbor noticed how his illness had devastated him, and sent a boy each day to take him food and drink.\n\nSang finally came around to entertaining suspicions about Li, so he said to her, “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to Lian Xiang’s advice before it all came to this!” When he finished speaking, he shut his eyes and lost consciousness. He revived a moment later, opened his eyes and looked around, but Li had vanished—and that was the end of their affair.\n\nSang lay wasting away in his lonely studio, wishing with the intensity of someone who’s starving for Lian Xiang to come. One day, just as he was concentrating his thoughts on her, someone suddenly pulled aside the curtain and entered: Lian Xiang. She approached his bed, smiling, and said, “This village boy, how can I forget you!”\n\nChoked with sobbing for a long time, and knowing that he was to blame, Sang begged her to save him. “Your disease has entered the vital organs,” Lian explained, “so it’s truly no longer possible for me to treat and cure you. I came because we’re about to be parted by your death, and I want to make it clear that I wasn’t jealous before.”\n\nExtremely distraught, Sang cried, “There’s a thing under my pillow that I must trouble you to destroy.” Lian searched and retrieved the slipper, then held it near the lamp, turning it over and over. Li suddenly entered, halting when she saw Lian Xiang, and turning to flee.\n\nWhen Lian moved to block the doorway, Li found herself in such a difficult position that she didn’t know where to go. Sang reproached her repeatedly, and Li found herself unable to reply. Lian smiled and said, “Finally we have met face to face. Earlier you told this gentleman that his lingering illness could only have been caused by me, but now what do you have to say?” Li bowed her head to acknowledge her wrongdoing. “A girl as beautiful as you,” Lian exclaimed, “how can you twist love into hatred?”\n\nLi flung herself to the ground, begging Lian to have pity and save Sang. Lian then helped her up, and asked her about her life before she died. Li replied, “I was the daughter of assistant magistrate Li, but died young and was buried next to the wall outside. Like a spring silkworm who dies too soon, I died too young to have fallen in love with anyone. To be together in love with Sang was my sole desire; but that I never meant to cause his death, I swear with all my heart.”\n\nLian observed, “I’ve heard that a ghost can bring about a person’s death so that after the person’s dead, they can always be together—isn’t that so?”\n\n“Not at all,” answered Li. “When two ghosts come together, neither is the happier for their union; if that kind of happiness were possible, the underworld would’ve provided me plenty of young men!”\n\nLian cried, “Ah, you’re crazy! Every night you’ve been doing it, even though Sang can’t take it, and yet you’re a ghost!”\n\n“Since foxes can kill people,” Li demanded, “what magic makes you exempt?”\n\nLian replied, “There are those foxes who make themselves strong by stealing the energy of mortal men, but I’m not one of them. There are foxes who do no harm to people, but there are absolutely no ghosts who do not kill, because the yin energy is too powerful in them.”\n\nSang heard her words and finally realized that the two actually were a fox and a ghost. Fortunately, since he’d grown accustomed to seeing them so often, he really wasn’t frightened of them at all. Nevertheless, he felt his breathing dwindle to a thread, and couldn’t suppress a loud cry of pain.\n\nLian, turning to look his direction, asked, “How shall we relieve him?” Li, shamefaced, humbly backed away. Lian laughed, and said, “I’m afraid that when his health recovers, your jealousy will devour him again.”\n\nLi gestured respectfully, and answered, “If there’s a doctor sufficiently talented to undo what I’ve done, I’ll gladly bury my head in the ground, for I could never dare to face the world again!”\n\nLian opened her bag and withdrew some medicine, declaring, “I knew today would come, so after I left, I went to pick herbs from three mountains over the course of three months, and now the ingredients are all prepared, so any man dying of consumption could be cured by this fool-proof medicine. However, there’s one condition—that it’s only effective if the one who caused the disease donates something to its cure.”\n\n“What do you need me to do?” asked Li.\n\nLian replied, “You must give him a drop of your saliva. I’ll put the pill in his mouth, then you must drip saliva into it.” Li, embarrassed all the more, lowered her head, turned aside, and glanced at her slipper. Lian made fun of her, crying, “Sister, you’re still only interested in your slipper!”\n\nLi’s shame increased while she raised and lowered her head, unable to contain her embarrassment. “This is one of your usual practices,” Lian remarked, “so why withhold it now?” Then she slipped a pill through Sang’s lips, and turned to compel Li to act. She responded with a drop of her saliva.\n\n“Again!” Lian demanded. Li offered her spit once more. In all, she spat three or four times, so Sang could swallow the pill. After a little while, his stomach began to make a great noise like cracks of thunder. Lian placed yet another pill in his mouth, then put her lips to his and breathed into him. Sang felt a burning heat in his lower abdomen sending the glow of energy throughout him. Lian cried, “He’s recovered!”\n\nLi heard the rooster crowing, looked around anxiously, then disappeared. Lian stayed with the newly-revived Sang, to build up his health again, since he couldn’t yet feed himself; hence she kept the outside door bolted shut, to pretend that Sang had returned to his hometown, thus breaking off contact with others, and watched over him day and night.\n\nLi also came without fail every night, offering her own earnest care to him, and treating Lian like her elder sister. Lian reciprocated with sincere sympathy and fondness. Three months later, Sang was as good as new.\n\nThen, for several nights, Li didn’t come around, and even when she did come, she just took a quick look at them and left right away. Whenever the three faced each other, Li seemed quite unhappy, so Lian often asked her to stay with them and rest, but she never agreed to do so.\n\nOnce Sang chased after her, and carried her back home in his arms, her body as light as one of the paper effigies burned to mourn the dead. She made no attempt to resist, laid down with her clothes on, and curled herself up tightly into a length less than two _chi_.\n\nLian, filled with pity for her, discreetly asked Sang to make love to her, but though he nudged her, Li wouldn’t wake up. Finally Sang also fell asleep; when he awoke, she was gone from sight.\n\nAfter more than ten days, she still hadn’t returned. Sang was feeling particularly unsettled, constantly taking out her slipper and caressing it. Lian remarked, “Even I’ve taken a fancy to her—let alone how you, a man, must feel.”\n\n“In the past,” Sang replied, “when I toyed with this slipper, she’d come, and though I suspected it quite often, I still didn’t expect that she’d really be a ghost. Now, thinking about her as I hold her slipper, I feel terribly sad.” Then he commenced to weep.\n\nPrior to this, in the wealthy Zhang family, there had been a fifteen-year-old daughter named Yan’er, who suddenly died without any warning signs. In the course of the night, she returned to life, got up, looked around, and wanted to rush off. The Zhangs bolted the door so she couldn’t get out.\n\nYan’er told them, “I am the spirit of an assistant magistrate’s daughter; feeling obliged to a gentleman named Sang, who thinks of me tenderly, I have left my slipper at his house. I’m really a ghost, so what’s the point of holding me here?”\n\nSince her words seemed reasonable enough, they asked her why she had come there. The girl lowered her head, pacing nervously and glancing about, unable to explain herself. When someone mentioned that Sang had been sick and had returned to his hometown, the girl insisted it couldn’t be. This quite puzzled her family members.\n\nSang’s neighbor to the east heard about all this, and when he climbed over the wall to sneak a peek, he saw Sang and a lovely woman speaking together; as he quietly entered and pressed onward, Sang’s visitor suddenly vanished from where she’d been. The neighbor, astonished, asked Sang what was going on.\n\nSang laughed, and said, “It’s like I told you: if any women come to visit, I’ll let them in.”\n\nHis neighbor then repeated Yan’er’s words to him. Sang consequently unbolted his door, and was about to go out and have a look for himself, but had no pretext to do so. Yan’er’s mother heard that he truly had not returned to his hometown, and was most amazed. When she sent an old servant woman to retrieve the slipper, Sang took it right out and gave it to her.\n\nYan’er was delighted. When she tried to put it on, however, the slipper proved too small for her foot by at least an inch, which really shook her up. She grabbed a mirror and looked at her reflection, suddenly realizing that she had come to life in someone else’s body, and then she explained the whole thing to the mother. From then on, the mother began to believe her.\n\nThe girl faced the mirror and cried, “There was a time when my appearance was nice, and I was quite self-confident, but even so, every time I saw elder sister Lian, I became more and more ashamed. Now my face has changed to this—I’d be better off as a ghost!” She held the slipper and wailed her sorrow inconsolably.\n\nCovering herself with a large quilt, she laid down, absolutely stiff. She ate nothing, so her body’s skin became swollen; for seven days she refused food, but still she didn’t die, and the swelling gradually receded; she felt so famished she couldn’t stand it, so she began to eat again. For several days her body itched all over, then all of her skin peeled off.\n\nWhen she got up in the morning, she found that her slippers had fallen off in her sleep, and as she tried to put them on, she discovered they were so large that they no longer fit her. Hence she tried on her former slipper and found its size to be a perfect fit, delighting her.\n\nAs she looked in the mirror, seeing her own eyebrows, eyes, and cheeks, just as they had always been, her joy increased. She washed and combed her hair before going to see her mother, and those who saw her couldn’t help but stare.\n\nWhen Lian Xiang heard the strange tale, she advised Sang to send a go-between to propose a marriage; but since he was poor while she was wealthy, and there seemed little chance of success, he didn’t dare go through with it.\n\nOn the birthday of Yan’er’s mother, he accompanied the mother’s other sons-in-law as they visited her to celebrate her longevity. When the old lady noticed Sang’s name among the others, she sent Yan’er to peep through the curtain, to survey the guests. Sang was the last to arrive, and Yan’er suddenly rushed out and caught hold of his sleeve, wanting to go back home with him. Her mother gave her quite a scolding, so she went back inside, ashamed.\n\nSang, who’d gotten a careful look at her and knew it was truly Li, couldn’t keep himself from crying, and subsequently prostrated himself, refusing to get up. The old lady finally raised him up, without thinking any the less of him. Sang went away and invited Yan’er’s uncle to serve as matchmaker. The old lady discussed the matter with him, and they selected an auspicious day for the wedding, after which Sang would come to Yan’er’s house to live.\n\nSang went home and told Lian Xiang, then discussed what to do next with her. Lian was upset for quite a long time, then expressed the wish to part with him. Sang, devastated, wept freely. Lian told him, “You’ll light the wedding candles with your new family, and if I were to go with you, how would I save face?”\n\nSang came up with the idea of returning to his home first with Lian, then afterwards welcoming Yan’er, and Lian went along with it. Sang then expressed his intentions to the Zhangs. When the Zhangs learned that he’d already set up a family, they became angry, expressing their resentment and indignation. Yan’er earnestly explained everything to their satisfaction.\n\nWhen the appointed day arrived, Sang went and brought Yan’er home. Everything in the house had been carefully prepared, though extremely inexpensively; yet when they arrived home, stretching from the gate to the end of the hall, woven carpets had been laid out and countless decorative lanterns hung as brightly-colored as brocade.\n\nLian Xiang assisted with the bride’s entrance to her new abode and removed her veil, to reveal her looking as radiant as she’d ever appeared. Lian joined them in drinking from the wedding cup, then they asked for the details of her strange return to life.\n\nYan’er replied, “When I was last with you, I was unable to restrain my sorrow. I began to despise my body as an alien thing, and felt unclean. After leaving you, I angrily refused to return to my grave and drifted aimlessly. Every time I saw living persons, I envied them.\n\n“In the daytime, I dwelt among the flora, and by night I wandered where my feet took me. Unexpectedly, I came to the Zhangs’ house and saw a young girl lying on her bed, approached and attached myself to her without realizing that I could return to life that way.” When Lian heard this she became silent, lost in thought.\n\nTwo more months went by, and Lian bore a son. After giving birth, she suddenly fell violently ill, and as the days went by, her condition steadily worsened. She clutched at Yan’er’s arm and told her, “I must burden you to take care of this child, your son as much as mine.” Yan’er’s tears fell as she tried hard to comfort Lian. She wanted to hire some magical healers for Lian Xiang, but Lian refused to allow it.\n\nHer condition deteriorated till she lay dying, her breathing as thin as a strand of silk. Sang stood by with Yan’er, both of them sobbing. Suddenly Lian opened her eyes and declared, “Don’t weep for me! Our child is happy to be alive, so I’m happy to die. If fate will have it so, in ten years we can see each other again.” Once she finished speaking the words, she died.\n\nWhen they opened her clothing as they were about to place her into a coffin, her body changed into that of a fox. Sang, unable to bear seeing Lian as a strange creature, gave her a lavish burial. The son was named Hu’er, and Yan’er loved him like he was her own child. Each Tomb-Sweeping Day, Sang and she hugged the boy at Lian’s grave, and wept together there.\n\nAfter Sang became a successful candidate in the imperial examination at the provincial level, his family gradually began to prosper. Yan’er, however, was deeply sad that she couldn’t bear him a child. Hu’er was quite intelligent, though frail and prone to sicknesses. Yan’er frequently wished that Sang would marry a second wife.\n\nOne day, a servant suddenly reported, “There’s an old woman outside the gate, accompanied by a girl whom she’s interested in selling.” Yan’er called out for them to enter.\n\nThe moment she saw the girl, Yan’er cried out in astonishment, “Sister Lian has come back!”\n\nSang looked her over and was equally amazed to find her exactly like Lian. He asked, “How old is she?”\n\n“Fourteen,” came the reply.\n\n“What’s her selling price?”\n\nThe old lady answered, “I only have this one child, but still I have to find a place for her, while all I need is simple food and somewhere to live, and to be sure that when I die, these old bones won’t be tossed into some ravine. Then I’ll be satisfied.” Sang offered her a good price, and had her stay.\n\nYan’er took the girl’s hand, and they stepped into a private room, where Yaner lifted the girl’s chin, smiled, and asked, “Do you know me?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” she answered. When Yan’er inquired about her name, the girl replied, “My surname is Wei. My father sold starch in Xucheng, but died three years ago.”\n\nYan’er counted on her fingers and realized that Lian had died exactly fourteen years earlier. She looked closely at the girl again: in both appearance and manner, she resembled no one so much as Lian. Yan’er then patted the top of her head, and exclaimed, “Sister Lian, sister Lian! The ten-year date you set before hasn’t let us down!”\n\nThe girl suddenly woke up as though from a dream, and spontaneously cried out in surprise, staring hard at Yan’er. Joining them, Sang laughed and said, “This is ‘like an old, familiar swallow that has come back home.’”\n\nThe girl, tears streaming from her eyes, declared, “It’s true. My mother once said that at the time I was born, I was able to speak, and thinking this inauspicious, I was given dog’s blood to drink, so I’d lose memory of my previous incarnation. But now it’s like I’m just awakening from a dream. Aren’t you little sister Li, who was ashamed to be a ghost?” They talked about their previous existence together, by turns saddened and jubilant.\n\nOne particular Qingming, Yan’er explained, “Every year, this is the day when the master and I go to weep for elder sister.” So they went to Lian’s grave, which was covered with weeds, while the tree growing over her coffin had grown so it took two arms to reach around it. The girl sighed deeply at the sight.\n\nYan’er said to Sang, “Sister Lian and I have cared for each other in two different worlds, and we can’t stand being separated, so it’s only right that our bones be buried in the same site.” Sang went along with their request, opened Li’s grave to retrieve her bones, and carried them back to be buried with Lian’s. Relatives and friends who had heard the strange story dressed auspiciously and gathered about the grave, not expecting the several hundred people who were there.\n\nA number of years into the reign of Kangxi, I was traveling south in Shandong when, hindered by rain, I stopped at an inn. A scholar there named Liu Zijing, Sang’s cousin, took out the biography of Sang, written by his colleague, Wang Zizhang—over ten thousand words long—for me to read. This story only covers its main points.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks: “It makes me sigh! One of them, dying, wishes to live, while another one, alive, wishes to die—everywhere under heaven, is there anything as hard as finding a human body? Those who possess such a body often don’t care for it as they should, so they’re equally uncomfortable as a living creature like the fox, or a dying spirit like the ghost.”",

        "body": "In the western part of Guangxi, there lived a famous scholar named Sun Zichu. He was born with an extra finger. Sun had a slow, deliberative way of speaking, and people always tried to cheat him, for he always believed whatever he was told. If there were singing girls sitting anywhere in his vicinity, even when he was spotting them from a distance, he’d try to run away from them shyly. Those who knew he responded this way would lure him into coming where prostitutes could be hired to act indecently familiar with him, whereupon he’d blush the entire length of his neck, while sweat rolled down his face in pearly drops.\n\nFor these reasons, everyone laughed at him. This made him look like such a dumbbell that people circulated malicious tales about him until he was nicknamed “Goofy Sun.”\n\nIn his town, there was a certain old man who was an influential merchant and was as wealthy as a prince. His relatives were all of noble descent. He had a daughter, called A-Bao, who was extremely beautiful. At that time, he wanted to choose a good mate for her, and the sons of all the great families sent their intentions with gifts, expressing their wishes to marry her, but none of them were suitable, in the old man’s opinion.\n\nSince Sun then had lost his wife, someone played a trick on him, advising him to contact a marriage broker about A-Bao. Sun naively had little notion that he was out of his depth, and hence proceeded to follow the advice.\n\nThe old man had known for some time that Sun was a talented scholar, but disapproved of him for his poverty. Just as the marriage broker was leaving, she happened to run into A-Bao, who asked why she’d come and was told.\n\nThe girl jokingly said, “If he lops off his extra finger, he can take me home with him.” The marriage broker then informed Sun.\n\nSun replied, “That’s not tough at all.” Once the broker left, Sun used an axe to cut off his extra finger, the severe pain of it penetrating to the heart of him, and so much blood poured out that he was on the verge of dying. It took several days before he was able to get up again, then went out to see the broker and showed her the finger.\n\nHorrified, the old lady broker ran off to inform ABao. The girl also found this startling, but in jest invited him this time to quit being goofy.\n\nWhen Sun heard this, he became upset, asserting that he was no fool; however, he had no way to see her and demonstrate that himself. He began to reconsider that maybe A-Bao wasn’t necessarily a celestial beauty after all, for what gave her the right to act so superior? Because of this, his former infatuation with her suddenly cooled.\n\nThen Qingming arrived, with its custom of women going out to walk through the streets; frivolous young men would join together and follow after them, unrestrainedly rating each of them. There were several young men of Sun’s acquaintance who strongly urged him to join them.\n\nIn mocking derision, one of them demanded, “Don’t you want a glance at your sweetie?” Sun knew they were making fun of him; but he’d already endured the girl’s ridicule, so he thought he’d get a look at her, and hence was delighted to follow along with the group and search her out.\n\nFrom a distance, they spotted a young woman resting beneath a tree, with a mob of insufferable young men surrounding her like a restraining wall. The group members agreed, “This has to be A-Bao.”\n\nThey hurried over and verified her identity. Attentive to every detail, they found her to be an unparalleled beauty. In a short while, the crowd became even more dense. A-Bao stood up and hastily left. The crowd was thrown into chaotic discussion about her appearance, the lot of them as disoriented as if they were crazy. Sun alone remained silent. The group went on ahead, and when they turned back to look at him, seeing Sun standing like an idiot in the same spot, they called to him, but he didn’t answer.\n\nThe group pulled him over to where they were, taunting him, “Did your spirit abandon you to follow A-Bao?” He still didn’t reply. The group knew him to be a fellow of few words, so no one thought this strange, and either by pushing or by pulling, they finally got him back home.\n\nOnce at home, he went straight to bed, laying there all day without getting up, unconscious as though he was passed out drunk, and though they shouted to him, he couldn’t be roused.\n\nHis family was afraid that his spirit had indeed abandoned him, and searched the countryside outside the household, calling out to it, but this proved to have no effect. They slapped Sun and questioned him, but his only response was the drowsy remark, “I’m at A-Bao’s house.” But when they asked for more information, he went silent again. His family members, anxious and perplexed, didn’t understand what was happening.\n\nOriginally, when Sun saw A-Bao leave, he couldn’t allow himself to be parted from her, so he felt his body following along behind her as she walked, till gradually he was right up next to her, and no one criticized him about it.\n\nThus he followed A-Bao home, where he sat and laid down next to her, and every night he made love to her, which they both found exceedingly pleasant; afterwards, however, Sun would feel extremely hungry, and though he longed to return home, he felt disoriented and didn’t know how to get there.\n\nA-Bao continually dreamt about having sex with a particular man, and when she’d ask him his name, he’d say, “I’m Sun Zichu.” She felt this to be very strange, but was unable to bring herself to tell anyone about it.\n\nSun lay in bed for three days, his breath dwindling as if it was just about to stop altogether. His family grew extremely worried, and went to break the matter gently to the old man, in hopes that he might invite them to search for Sun’s spirit in his household.\n\nThe old man laughed and said, “In the past, we never made a practice of visiting each other, so why would his spirit have become lost in my house?” Sun’s family remained resolute in their pleading, so the old man finally agreed to permit the search.\n\nA master of magic arrived, carrying some of Sun’s old clothing and a straw mat. A-Bao, upon asking him the reason for his visit, was astonished that Sun’s spirit was in her family’s house, and guided the master directly to her bedroom, where she let him summon the spirit and then take his leave.\n\nBy the time the magic master had reached the Sun family’s gate, Sun was already moaning from his bed. Upon awakening, he was able to describe what toiletries and possessions A-Bao kept in her room, what they looked like, what they were called, and all without a mistake.\n\nWhen A-Bao heard about this, her amazement increased, and she secretly felt moved by the profound degree of his love.\n\nOnce Sun was able to leave his bed, he became totally engrossed in his thoughts, completely absent-minded. He was always trying to catch a glimpse of A-Bao, hoping for the good fortune of encountering her once again. During the Buddha Bathing Festival, he heard that she was going to offer incense at the Shuiyue Monastery, so at daybreak he went to wait for her by the side of the road, his eyes dazzled from straining so hard to watch for her.\n\nThe sun had already passed noon when A-Bao appeared, spotting Sun when she peered out from her carriage, and subsequently pulled aside the curtain with her delicate hands while staring at him without turning away. Sun moved forward, trailing along after her.\n\nA-Bao suddenly ordered a maid servant to go ask the gentleman his name. Sun eagerly answered the question, his spirit feeling even more agitated than before. When the carriage left the monastery, he headed home.\n\nAt home, he became sick once more, fell into a trance, and stopped eating, in his dreams always calling out A-Bao’s name. He berated his spirit for not being able to follow her once again.\n\nWhen the old parrot which belonged to his family suddenly died, a child held its body and played with it on a bed. Sun thought to himself that if only he had the parrot’s body, with just a flap of the wings he could be in A-Bao’s room. As his mind fixated on the parrot, he felt his body become the parrot’s, and he hastily flew off, straight to A-Bao’s place.\n\nThe girl, delighted, caught the bird, tied it to a perch, and fed it hempseeds. With a loud squawk, it cried, “Elder sister, don’t tie me up! It’s me, Sun Zichu!”\n\nA-Bao, utterly shocked, untied the string, but the bird didn’t fly away. The girl blessed it, saying, “Your sincerity has engraved itself on my heart. But now we’re of different species, human and bird, so how can we be joined in love together?”\n\nThe parrot replied, “Just to be near the fragrance of you is everything I desire.” If other people tried to feed it, the parrot wouldn’t eat; when A-Bao herself fed it, it ate, and when she sat down, it would perch on her knee; and when she laid down, it would sit next to her bed.\n\nSo it went for three days. A-Bao felt great pity for the bird, and privately sent someone to check on Sun’s condition. The scholar had lain stiff, without breathing, for three days, yet the area over his heart had not turned cold.\n\nOnce again, A-Bao gave the parrot her blessings: “If you can become human again, I swear I’ll be yours till I die.”\n\n“You’re lying to me!” squawked the parrot. A-Bao swore she wasn’t. The parrot cocked its head to the side, as though thinking it over.\n\nA little later, when A-Bao decided to bind her feet a bit tighter, and hence took off her shoes, putting them under her bed, the parrot suddenly swooped down, snatched the shoes in its beak, and flew off, with A-Bao calling out to it as it disappeared into the distance.\n\nA-Bao sent an old woman to go and discern Sun’s condition, and the old woman found the scholar already awake. His family members had seen the parrot arrive with the shoes in its beak, then fall to the ground dead, and everyone had agreed it was incredibly strange. As soon as he had revived, Sun called for the shoes. No one there could figure out what had happened to him.\n\nWhen the old woman arrived and walked in to see Sun, she demanded the whereabouts of the shoes. “A-Bao gave them to me as a betrothal gift,” replied Sun. “Tell her for me that I have not forgotten her precious promise.” The old woman did as she was directed.\n\nA-Bao thought this all the more strange. Hence she sent a maid servant to describe everything to her mother. Her mother carefully verified the report’s accuracy, then said, “This young man’s reputation for talent isn’t bad, but he’s as poor as Xiangru. If after several years of searching we choose a son-in-law like this, I’m afraid the prominent families will laugh at us.” However, because of the shoes incident, A-Bao swore that she would have no one else but him. Her mother and father went along with her decision.\n\nThey sent the news quickly to Sun, who was overjoyed, and suddenly recovered from his illness.\n\nA-Bao’s father discussed having Sun move in with them. “A son-in-law can’t live for long in the household of his wife’s parents,” A-Bao responded. “Besides, Sun’s already poor, so that would simply give people more reason to think him worthless. I’ve given him my word, so I’ll live in his thatched hut and enjoy his humble food without regret.” Sun then married A-Bao and took her home with him, and they seemed together like beloveds who’d been separated in a previous life, now rejoined.\n\nOf course, A-Bao’s family gave her a dowry, a small fortune that significantly improved their circumstances. But “Goofy” Sun, who was too obsessed with studying, didn’t know how to manage the family’s business interests; fortunately, A-Bao was adept at handling their assets, so she didn’t burden Sun with business matters. After managing things thus for three years, they became quite rich.\n\nSun suddenly fell ill with diabetes, then died of it. A-Bao wept piteously, crying her eyes out, then just stopped sleeping or eating. When others tried to encourage her, she wouldn’t listen, hence she took advantage of nightfall to hang herself. A maid servant discovered her attempt and quickly rescued her, so A-Bao revived, yet she still refused to eat.\n\nThree days later, Sun’s relatives had gathered and were just about to inter his body. They heard a groan and gasp of breath from inside his coffin, then opened it, verifying that he’d come back to life. He told them, “I appeared before the Hell King, and because I’ve been a just and honest person, he ordered that I be given an official appointment. Suddenly a man announced, ‘Minister Sun’s wife is about to arrive.’\n\n“The King checked his registry of ghosts and declared, ‘It’s not yet her time to die.’\n\n“The man replied, ‘She didn’t eat for three days.’\n\n“The King turned to look at me and said, ‘Being moved by your wife’s devotion, for the time being I will allow you to return to life.’ Hence he sent a servant to harness horses and bring me home.” From this time forward, Sun’s health steadily improved.\n\nIt happened then that the date arrived for the provincial civil service examination, and as it approached, some young men decided to play a joke on Sun by secretly drawing up seven odd, phony examination topics, then luring him to a secluded place to tell him, “Thanks to somebody’s bribes, we’re able to show you the examiners’ topics.”\n\nSun believed them, working day and night on these seven topics, till he’d successfully completed the seven essays. The group hid their laughter from him.\n\nAt that time, the civil service examiners, concerned that overly-familiar themes might promote the copying of previous work, did everything they could to turn the usual topics into unusual ones. When the examination papers were distributed, all seven matched up with Sun’s essays. Accordingly, he was selected as the best of the examinees. The following year, Sun qualified as a _jinshi_ and was granted a place in the Hanlin Academy.\n\nWhen the emperor heard of these curious events, he summoned Sun to appear for questioning. Sun delivered his report to the emperor and awaited his reactions. The delighted ruler praised him effusively. Afterwards, the empress also summoned A-Bao, and lavished expensive gifts on her.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The quality of foolishness may assist an individual in developing determination, for it’s the case that someone who’s crazy for books will certainly prove to be a skilled writer, while someone who’s nuts for art will have what it takes to develop fine artistic ability; those who fail to develop themselves, and never accomplish anything, would all say that there’s nothing goofy about _them_. It’s the same with those who squander money on painted ladies, or who ruin their families through gambling—such people, on examination, are the ones who’re really foolish! Therefore, if one is clever and artful, even to excess, then one can be said to be truly goofy, and what goofiness Master Sun has in that sense!”\n\nHere’s a collection of ten sayings that really exhibit foolishness: “Save your money—but if you do, you’ll eat poorly. Boast of your son’s intelligence in front of your guests. You can love a child, but never teach him to read. Be afraid of telling people about the disease you have. Invest your earnings in prostitutes. Steal so you can spend your gains on drinking and gambling. Fool the debt collector by signing your IOUs with the names of your father and brothers. A father and son’s accounts are always perfectly balanced. The family should be used the way one uses a machine. Always like your students who are good at gambling.”",

        "title": "King of the Nine Mountains",
        "body": "A man named Li, who lived in Caozhou, was a successful candidate there in the first level civil service examination. While his family had traditionally been well off, their home wasn’t very extensive; behind it was a garden, several _mu_ in size, that had not been used for a long time. One day, an old man arrived to rent a room from Li, and straightaway took out a hundred taels.\n\nLi explained that they didn’t have any rooms to let, so he’d have to decline. The old man replied, “Please accept it, don’t trouble yourself about it.” Li didn’t understand what he meant, so he accepted the money, figuring that he’d wait and see what would happen.\n\nThe next day, the villagers saw swarms of horses and carriages filled with people entering the Li family’s gate, one after another, seriously doubting that Li could find room for them all, and asked him what was going on. Li had no idea, either; he hurried home to look into it, and found no traces of them whatsoever.\n\nAfter several days had gone by, the old man suddenly showed up to pay a visit. He declared, “We’ve come to you for shelter for several days and nights. Everything’s already been put together, a stove’s been set up for cooking—we haven’t had time to arrange an invitation to show you our gratitude until now. I’ve sent my daughters to prepare some food, so I hope you’ll come and honor us with your presence.” Li followed him.\n\nAs they entered the garden, Li suddenly saw a splendid house that looked brand new. When he walked inside, he discovered the furnishings to be quite beautiful. A cauldron of wine was heating on the verandah, and the delicate scent of steaming tea issued from the kitchen. Instantly, wine and food were brought out that included fabulous delicacies.\n\nSoon Li saw young men appear in the courtyard, going and coming in large numbers. He also heard children whispering, making the sounds of laughter, and words from behind a screen. With all the servants, it seemed like there were nearly a hundred people working for the old man’s family. Li realized that they had to be foxes. When the banquet was finished, he went back to his house, darkly entertaining thoughts of killing them.\n\nEach time he went to the market he bought some saltpeter and sulfur, till he’d accumulated several hundred _jin_ worth, and hid it, buried in the garden, until he was ready to use it. When he suddenly ignited the saltpeter and sulfur, the blaze stretched up into the sky like a black fungus, so the burnt stench of the ashes made Li squint, unable to go near the fire; he heard the cry of animals howling and fleeing, a horrible clamor of noise. As soon as the fire was put out, he went into the garden to take a look, and found the ground covered with dead foxes, their heads horribly charred, so he was unable to count them exactly.\n\nWhile he surveyed the grounds, he encountered the old man entering the garden from outside, wearing a deeply grieved expression, and reproaching Li bitterly: “We had no permanent enmity; your garden was leased for one hundred taels, which was no small amount of money; so how could you mastermind the extermination of my clan? This extraordinarily cruel act of malice must be recompensed!” He left in a fit of anger. Li feared that the old man would begin heaving stones at his household, but for more than a year, nothing at all strange occurred.\n\nIn the early years of Shunzhi’s reign in the Qing dynasty, a gang of thieves came into being in the mountains, with vast numbers of men banding together, and the officials were unable to arrest them. With so many members having sprung up, Li was constantly concerned about being attacked by the bandits. A man who could predict the future appeared in Li’s village, calling himself “The Old Man of the Southern Mountains,” telling people tales of good fortune and bad which were so close to real events that they made him quite famous in the village.\n\nLi had him summoned to his home, and asked him to tell him his fortune, according to his birthdate. The old man, stunned, kowtowed to Li and exclaimed, “The man with this birthday is really an emperor!” When Li heard this, he was quite astonished, considering the comment absurd. The old man’s face and voice became solemn, to confirm that his words were serious.\n\nLi, suspicious that the old fellow wasn’t all there, asked him, “How can that be, since a person can’t just become emperor from being empty-handed.”\n\n“That’s not true,” the old man answered. “Since ancient times, haven’t many emperors grown up as ordinary people, proving that not every emperor became one through birthright?” Li was puzzled by this, and moved his seat closer to the old man. The old man determinedly regarded himself as a “sleeping dragon.” He asked for Li to equip himself with the very finest armor and helmet, and the very best bow and crossbow.\n\nLi pondered this, and felt it unlikely that anybody would support him in such a claim. The old man declared, “I’d like to ask that you issue the order for me to go and communicate with the bandit leaders on the several mountains, and draw up an alliance with them. I can send someone to spread the rumor that you are the real emperor, and then the soldiers in the mountains would certainly agree to support you.” Li was flattered, and sent the old man on his way. He drew upon his cash reserves in order to have armor made.\n\nAfter several days, the old man returned to make the trip with him, and advised, “Take advantage of your fortune and blessings, plus my skills as an orator, and all of the bandit leaders on the mountains will agree to listen to you and to fight for you.” Over the space of the next ten days, over a thousand men joined Li’s army.\n\nHe paid respect appropriately to the old man, and regarded him as his military strategist; he had an enormous banner made, and set up a forest of colored flags; as Li’s army grew stronger and more people began to hear about it, the cities sent out troops to take punitive action against the bandits, and with the old man commanding Li’s forces, the city troops were soundly defeated. Badly demoralized, the county officials requested reinforcements from the official in the provincial prefecture. The prefecture’s soldiers would have to make a long, arduous journey to arrive there, so the old man again advanced the bandit forces to attack, completely routing the city soldiers, his officers and men inflicting widespread casualties.\n\nTheir reputation continued to expand as the gang members reached to over ten thousand, and for that reason Li gave himself the name, “King of the Nine Mountains.” The old man, worried about the scant number of their horses, heard from the capital that some horses were being sent to this province, so he dispatched a brigade to seize and hold the horses that were on the way. After this, the reputation of the “King of the Nine Mountains” became all the greater. The old man also declared him “Guardian of the State and Supreme Commander of the Army.” Living in seclusion in their mountain lair, Li openly boasted about himself, and declared that in just a limited number of days, he would soon be wearing the imperial yellow robe.\n\nMeanwhile, because of the incident involving seizure of the horses, the provincial governor sent out troops to oppose Li, and received support from higher officials, who sent out their most excellent troops in further aid; they surrounded the bandits from six directions, and then closed in. The government troops’ banners filled the entire mountain valley.\n\nThe “King of the Nine Mountains” was terrified, and summoned the old man to work out a plan, but no one knew where he’d gone. Hard-pressed and with no tactics of his own, the “King of the Nine Mountains” climbed to the top of the mountain and exasperatedly cried out, “Now I know how great is the power of this dynasty!”\n\nThe mountain stronghold was captured, its inhabitants taken prisoner, their wives and children killed. Li suddenly understood that the old man was really the old fox, who’d avenged the extermination of his clan by wiping out Li’s own.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “If husbands would just live with their wives and children happily, with the doors of their households closed, how could they ever kill anyone? And even if they could kill, why would they ever destroy an entire clan? The fox’s plan was quite ingenious. However, if there had been no evil thoughts in Li’s own mind, the plot wouldn’t have germinated, even with the old man trying to cultivate it; the man who killed the foxes was savage, and that shows that his heart already possessed evil roots, so the fox encouraged those roots to sprout and then conducted his plan of revenge. Now we can directly test passersby by saying to them, ‘You’re really an emperor!’ Henceforth, everybody will be shaken up, and run away.\n\n“Obviously, Li was guided towards the sacrifice of his entire family, but he was still happy to listen to the advice. Hence he can’t blame anyone else for his family being destroyed, can he? A man listens to insane comments and initially is angered by them, but if he becomes intrigued, he’ll continue to give credence to those suspicions until his life and reputation are both destroyed, and then he realizes that his own faults have led to the disaster; this is the general rule of this kind of thing.”",

        "body": "Master Qiu, of Zhucheng, governed the Zunhua district. Many foxes had gotten into the office there. Finally, the last building was taken by them to use as their home. Occasionally they went out and did bad things to people, but trying to dispel them just made them behave even worse. The officials who had once lived there had made sacrifices, and had prayed, but no one dared to oppose the foxes.\n\nWhen Master Qiu arrived at his post, and heard about all this, he became furious. The foxes feared him as upright and unyielding, so one changed into an old woman and told his servants, “I’d like to make this petition to His Excellency: there’s no point in mutual enmity. If he can give me three days, I’ll take the others with me and we’ll slink away.” Master Qiu overheard this, but said nothing.\n\nThe next day, when he finished reviewing the troops, he ordered them not to disperse, sent them to their camp to bring over all of their large cannons, and then surrounded the Zunhua office’s last building with them; over a thousand cannons fired on the last building—which collapsed at once despite being several stories tall—while skin, flesh, fur, and blood began to rain down from the sky.\n\nThey also saw that in the midst of the resulting dark, dense, poisonous fog, a wisp of white vapor was belched out, and then vanished. The crowd of soldiers looked into the distance and cried, “There’s a fox running off.” Afterwards, everything was once again safe and sound in the Zunhua office.\n\nAfter two years, Master Qiu, angling for a transfer and promotion, sent a loyal and canny servant to carry a certain amount of silver to the capital. When the business didn’t work out, he stored it temporarily in a pit at the house of one of the office’s employees.\n\nSuddenly, an old man appeared, claiming he’d been wronged, saying his wife and children had been violently murdered. He accused Master Qiu of cutting back on the army’s provisions, in order to use the money to ingratiate himself with powerful people, as would be immediately apparent at a certain household if they would investigate and verify it. Someone accepted the petition and pledged to look into it.\n\nArriving at the employee’s house, they searched everywhere but found nothing. The old man kept pacing the same plot of ground. Realizing what it meant, they pointed out the spot, and soon they discovered the silver; engraved on it were characters spelling out, “Transported and guarded by this county.” They stopped to look for the old man, but he’d vanished from the premises.\n\nWhen they searched for him, according to the name and address he left them, this, too, turned up nothing. As a consequence, Master Qiu got into some hot water and was sentenced for his deed. That’s when he realized that the old man was the fox that had fled.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Foxes that plague people deserve to be severely punished. However, if they obey and abandon their wickedness, we should also treat them humanely. It can be said of Master Qiu that ‘he hated the fox too aggressively.’ But if his actions had been carried out by Guan Xi, even a hundred foxes couldn’t have achieved revenge on him!”",

        "title": "Zhang Cheng",
        "body": "There was a Henan man named Zhang, who had lived in Shandong before that. At the end of the Ming dynasty, when Shandong fell into general chaos, his wife was carried off by northern soldiers. Zhang had often been a trader to Henan, so he fled there with his family. He married a Henan woman who bore him a son named Ne. Before long, she died, and he remarried, that wife giving birth to a son named Cheng.\n\nZhang’s new wife, named Niu, was overbearing and constantly hateful towards Ne, treating him like a beast of burden, and feeding him only marginally edible fodder. He was sent to collect firewood, and each day it was his responsibility to bring back a shoulder’s load; whenever he failed to do so, he was soundly whipped and abusively cursed, till it was almost more than Ne could stand. Meanwhile, Niu secretly set aside tasty cakes for Cheng, and sent him to a private tutor for reading instruction.\n\nAs Cheng grew up over time, he proved by nature to be full of filial piety and brotherly love, and since he couldn’t stand to see his elder brother, Ne, exhausted all the time, he confidentially tried to dissuade his mother from her treatment of him. But she wouldn’t listen to him.\n\nOne day, Ne went into the mountains to collect firewood, but before he’d gathered enough, a huge storm blew up and he took refuge beneath a rock outcropping, and by the time the rain stopped and it cleared off, it was already late. He was utterly famished, so he slung the firewood over his back and headed home.\n\nNiu checked and found him short of the expected load, so in anger she refused him anything to eat; his hunger burning inside him, he went to his room and laid down, stiff and motionless. When Cheng came home from studying with his tutor, and saw Ne looking so dejected, he asked, “Are you feeling sick?”\n\nNe replied, “I’m just hungry.” Cheng asked him to explain, and when Ne told him what had happened, Cheng’s expression became grave, and he rushed out.\n\nA moment later, he returned with some cakes stuck inside his robe for his brother. Ne asked him where he’d gotten them. Cheng replied, “I took some flour and asked the neighbor lady to make them, so don’t talk—just eat.” Ne gobbled them down.\n\nThen he advised his younger brother, “After this, don’t do it again. If word gets out, you’ll be blamed. I get one meal a day, so the hunger isn’t going to kill me.”\n\n“Brother, you’ve been weakened,” Cheng insisted, “so you don’t have the strength to collect firewood!”\n\nThe following day, after eating, Cheng stole off to the mountains to the place where Ne was collecting his firewood. His older brother spotted him, and asked in surprise, “What are you doing here?”\n\nCheng replied, “I’m here to help gather firewood.”\n\n“Who sent you?” asked Ne.\n\nHe replied, “I came by myself.”\n\nNe told him, “There’s no point talking about it, since you can’t cut firewood—but even if you could, you mustn’t.” Consequently, he urged him to go home. Cheng wouldn’t listen, using his hands and feet to break up limbs to help his brother.\n\nThen he told Ne, “Tomorrow I should bring an axe when I come.”\n\nNe came over to dissuade him. He saw that his brother’s fingers had been scratched up, and that he’d worn holes in his shoes, so he felt bad about it, and cried out, “If you don’t go home quickly, I’ll take this axe to my throat and kill myself!”\n\nCheng then headed home. Ne accompanied him halfway there, then turned back around. Once he’d gathered his firewood, he, too, went home, stopping by the tutor’s school to pay a visit, where he advised the master, “My brother is still young, so you should keep him inside here. There are many tigers and wolves out there in the mountains.”\n\nThe master said, “I didn’t know where he’d been going before noon, but I’ve already beaten him for it.” Ne went home and told Cheng, “You didn’t listen to my words, so now you’ve suffered a beating for it.”\n\nCheng smiled, and said, “No big deal.”\n\nThe next day, Cheng hefted the axe, and again headed out.\n\nNe, astonished at his arrival, said, “I specifically told you not to come back, so why have you returned?” Cheng didn’t reply, but simply chopped up firewood for a long while, eager to help, the sweat pouring down his cheeks as he worked without ceasing. When he’d collected enough to make up a bundle, he turned back without a word of farewell.\n\nThe master scolded him again, so Cheng revealed the truth to him. Expressing admiration for his virtue, the master lifted the prohibition on his leaving.\n\nOne day, the brothers were out in the mountains with several other men, when suddenly a tiger appeared. The frightened group spread themselves flat on the ground. The tiger eventually lifted Cheng up in its mouth and carried him off. Lugging Cheng, the tiger made very little progress, so Ne was able to chase it and catch up with it. He swung his axe at it, and caught the tiger in the thigh. The beast roared in agony and ran off so swiftly that Ne was unable to keep up with it, and had to turn back, bitterly weeping.\n\nThe others tried to console him, but he sobbed all the more miserably, crying out, “My younger brother was one of a kind; besides, he died for me, so how can I go on living!” Then he raised his axe up to cut his own throat. The group rushed to stop him, but the axe had already entered his flesh about a _cun_, and blood was gushing out. He became dizzy and fainted. The men, aghast, ripped up some of his clothing and used it to stop the bleeding, then helped him get home.\n\nHis mother, weeping and cursing, cried, “You killed my son, now you want a nick in the neck to take you off the hook!”\n\nNe groaned, “Mother, don’t vex yourself. Younger brother is dead, and I have no reason to go on living!” He was placed on his bed, but with the pain from his wound he couldn’t sleep, so day and night he huddled against the wall, sobbing.\n\nHis father was afraid that Ne, too, might die, so he frequently came to his bedside to feed him, with Niu reproaching him for it each time. Ne then stopped eating, and three days later, he died.\n\nIn their village lived a mage, who acted as a courier to the underworld, and Ne ran into him en route there, subsequently recounting to him the suffering of the past several days. When he inquired about Cheng’s whereabouts, the mage told him that he hadn’t heard anything. Then he turned, and led Ne along with him.\n\nThey came to a large city, where they saw a man in black coming their way. The mage stepped in front of him, and asked him some questions. The man took out a document from a bag he wore at his waist, and looked it over carefully, examining the hundred-odd names of men and women there, but didn’t find a Zhang among them.\n\nThe mage suspected that it was listed in someone else’s documents. But the man told them, “This is my jurisdiction, so there’s no reason for Zhang Cheng to be taken by the others.” Ne refused to accept this, and strongly insisted that the mage accompany him inside the city.\n\nOnce they were inside the city walls, they saw recent ghosts as well as ones who’d been there awhile, gliding here and there, and when they recognized some of them, they went to make inquiries, but found that no one yet knew anything about Cheng.\n\nSuddenly they all raised their voices to exclaim, “The Bodhisattva has come!”\n\nWhen Ne looked up into the clouds, there was an enormous figure, with dazzling rays of light emanating from her, till suddenly everything around them was brightly lit. The mage congratulated Ne: “Young sir, you’re in luck! The Bodhisattva only comes to the underworld once every so many decades, to attend to things regarding the disposition of spirits, so now’s the perfect time to be here.” Then he pulled Ne down onto his knees.\n\nThe multitude of ghosts also noisily knelt, putting their palms together and chanting for the merciful one to rescue them from their suffering, till the sound of their entreaties shook the ground. The Bodhisattva waved her willow branch, sprinkling sweet dew over everyone, its spray as fine as mist. Suddenly the mist ceased, the light faded, and the Bodhisattva vanished.\n\nNe felt some of the dew on his neck, and the place where the axe had wounded him no longer caused him any pain. The mage, as before, led Ne away with him and they returned home. Not until they could see the village gates in the distance did the mage take his leave and depart.\n\nNe had been dead for two days, when all of a sudden he revived, related everything that had transpired in the underworld, and then reported that Cheng wasn’t dead. Niu figured he was making it all up and accused him of falsifying, heaping more verbal abuse on him. Though Ne was being wronged, he had no way to defend himself, yet when he touched his wound, he felt a scar there and knew he truly had been healed.\n\nHe marshaled his strength to get up, and pledged to his father, “I’m going to enter the clouds and scour the seas to search for my brother, and if I can’t find him, don’t look for me to return as long as this body has life in it. I want you to think of me, father, as if I were still dead.” The old man led him over to a private space, and there he wept with him, not daring to ask him to stay.\n\nNe then departed. At every thoroughfare, he invested his resources to search for his brother, and once he’d exhausted his traveling money en route, he became a beggar and continued on. A year passed, till he reached Jinling, his clothing in tatters, having become hunchbacked along the way.\n\nHe spotted a group of ten or so riders passing through, and had to step aside to get out of their way. Ne noticed one man who looked like a senior official, about forty years old, accompanied by robust men on sturdy, powerful mounts, galloping and capering before and behind him. A young man, riding a smaller horse, kept staring over at Ne. Ne figured that the young man must be the son of a high official, so he didn’t dare return his glance.\n\nThe young man reined in and halted his modest steed, then suddenly dismounted and cried out, “If it isn’t my elder brother!” Ne raised his head to take a careful look, and sure enough, it was Cheng. As he grasped Cheng’s hands, Ne felt a great pang of sorrow and broke down in tears.\n\nWeeping along with him, Cheng asked, “Elder brother, what has happened to bring you to this state?” As Ne described his experiences to him, Cheng’s sympathy increased all the more. The other riders dismounted to ask what was going on, then explained it to the senior official.\n\nThe official ordered them to provide a horse for Ne to ride, then the brothers joined their reins and rode together back to the official’s home, with Ne asking Cheng to tell him his story from the beginning.\n\nOriginally, after the tiger carried Cheng off, he’d been unconscious when it dropped him along the road, and he lay there all night long. It happened that the official, Zhang Biejia, had just come from the capital, and as he passed, noticing Cheng’s cultured appearance, he took pity on him and cared for him, till he gradually regained consciousness.\n\nCheng told the official his address, which was a long distance away. Hence the official took him home with him. There he applied medicine to Cheng’s wounds, and several days later, he’d begun to recover. Biejia had no heir, so he adopted Cheng. They had just been out for a ride when he caught sight of Ne.\n\nWhile he was explaining everything to his brother, Biejia entered, and Ne respectfully thanked him over and over. Cheng went inside and carried out some silk clothing for his elder brother, then he put on a feast for him, so they could chat while enjoying the food.\n\nBiejia asked him, “Since your family is in Henan, how many able-bodied men are there in your hometown?”\n\n“There aren’t any,” Ne replied. “Father grew up in Shandong, only later relocating to Henan.”\n\nBiejia commented, “I’m also from Shandong. What county is your village part of?”\n\n“In the past,” Ne replied, “father said that it was part of Dongchang’s administrative territory.”\n\nAmazed, Biejia exclaimed, “I’m from the same hometown! Why did you move to Henan?”\n\nNe explained, “At the close of the Ming, soldiers poured in, abducted my father’s first wife, and then left. My father had to endure soldiers burning everything down, and carrying off his wife. Earlier he’d conducted business in the west, going and coming, so he was quite familiar with the area, and for that reason he settled there.”\n\nEven more amazed, Biejia asked, “What is your father’s name?” Ne told him. Biejia stared at him with his eyes wide, lowered his head as if pondering something, then quickly rushed inside.\n\nBefore long, Biejia’s mother came out. Together the brothers kowtowed to her, and once they’d finished, she asked Ne, “Are you Zhang Bingzhi’s grandson?”\n\n“That’s correct,” he answered.\n\nBiejia’s mother began to weep, saying to Biejia, “These are your younger brothers.” The brothers found themselves tongue-tied. Biejia’s mother explained, “I was married to your father for three years, then carried off to the north by a commander named Hei, and half a year afterwards, I gave birth to your elder brother. Another six months later, the commander died, and your elder brother in time filled a vacancy under his banner, moving up gradually to take the commander’s place. Now he’s been released from that appointment.\n\n“Each and every moment, I think about my real home, so I separated myself from the northerners and resumed my previous identity. Time and again, when I sent people to Shandong, no one could learn anything, but how was anyone to know that your father had moved west!” Then she added to Biejia, “But making your younger brother your son—you destroy your own blessings and posterity!”\n\nBiejia answered, “In the past, when I asked Cheng about himself, he never said anything about being from Shandong, so he must have been too young to recall it.”\n\nThen they organized themselves by age: Biejia, forty-one years old, was the elder Zhang son; Cheng, at sixteen, was the youngest; Ne was twenty-two, previously the elder of Zhang’s sons, but now the middle brother of all three. Having two younger brothers made Biejia very happy, and they all slept together in the same room so he could learn the causes behind their having become separated, while he made plans for them to return home.\n\nHis mother was afraid that Niu wouldn’t accept them. Biejia told her, “If she can accept us, we’ll live together, and if not, we’ll split up. Who in the world wouldn’t want to return to his father’s home?” Thereupon, he sold his house and packed up everything, having set the day when they would head westward.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at their village, Ne joined Cheng to ride ahead and announce the news to their father. After Ne left home, Niu died; their father had become a solitary old widower, perpetually in mourning. When he suddenly saw Ne enter, he was so happy that he felt faint from the strain; upon seeing Cheng, he was absolutely ecstatic, unable even to speak a word, his tears falling freely.\n\nThen they told him that Biejia and his mother would arrive soon, so the old man stopped his weeping, stunned, torn between joy and sorrow, and just stood there like a simpleton. It wasn’t long until Biejia entered and paid his respects to his father; his mother clasped the old man in her arms, and they wept together.\n\nSince all the female and male servants had come down to meet them, and were all over the place, inside and outside, the old man didn’t know what to do, whether to sit or to stand. When Cheng didn’t see his own mother, and asked after her, he learned that she had died; wailing until he was hoarse, he then fainted, but shortly afterward began to revive.\n\nBiejia financed the building of a new house, and engaged a tutor to instruct his two younger brothers; horses were soon capering in the stables, the rooms of the house were filled with boisterous chatter, and, surprisingly, they became a rich and influential family.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Hearing this business all the way to its conclusion provokes my tears to fall: a boy ten years or so old, chopping wood to help his brother; I admire him, and cry out, ‘This is another Wang Lan in the world!’ And then my tears fall the first time. When I hear that the tiger has carried off Cheng, I can’t help wailing and sobbing, “Why must heaven be so unfair!” So I cry for the second time. Elder and younger brothers unexpectedly meet again, which causes me to weep anew, for the young brothers suddenly have an elder brother, and I feel sorry for Biejia for having lost so many years of brotherhood—hence I shed tears once again. A family is reunited out of both sad and happy circumstances, and though I shouldn’t cry, I cry also for the old man. I wonder whether in later generations there will be people like me who shed tears so easily.”",

At first he thought she was his wife’s servant, so he didn’t look up at her; and when he did raise his eyes, he realized that he didn’t recognize her, though she looked quite beautiful. He knew in his heart that she was a fox, but he lusted for her nonetheless, and hastily called for her to come.\n\nShe stopped with a smile, and said, “That stern sound’s meant for me, but who are you calling your maidservant?”\n\nZhu laughed and stood up, dragging her over to sit with him, where he could apologize for his mistake. Then he made love to her, and for a long while they lived together happily as husband and wife.\n\nSuddenly one day, she said to him, “You’re going to have to give up your appointment—there isn’t much time.”\n\n“When must I do it?” he asked.\n\n“Right away,” she smiled. “There may be congratulations at your gates now, but there will be mourning in your village soon, so you can’t remain an official.”\n\nThree days later, he received an announcement that he should relinquish his appointment. The next day, he was given news of his mother’s death. Zhu resigned his post, desiring that the fox accompany him to his hometown. But his fox wife couldn’t agree to do so.\n\nShe accompanied him to the river’s edge. There he tried to force her aboard the ferry with him. The girl told him, “You wouldn’t know this, but foxes can’t cross rivers.” Zhu couldn’t bear to be apart from her, and expressed his love for her there at the river bank. The girl suddenly rushed off, saying she had to visit an old friend.\n\nAfter a bit she returned, and now she had a man with her, returning the visit she’d just made. The girl uttered something to her guest. Once he’d left, the fox came back to Zhu, saying, “Please climb aboard the ferry at your convenience—I’ll be joining you for the crossing.”\n\nZhu replied, “According to your own words, you can’t make the crossing, so why are you saying this now?”\n\n“The one who just paid us a visit is the river god,” explained the fox wife. “I used you as the rationale for making a special request of him. He gave me permission to cross the river within the next ten days, so I can accompany you and stay with you for that long.” Then they crossed the river together. On the tenth day, consequently, she said farewell and left."

        "title": "Qiaoniang",
        "body": "In Guandong, there was a government official named Fu, who was over sixty when he had a son, named Lian. Lian was extremely bright, but he’d been endowed with rather inadequate reproductive equipment, so even at the age of seventeen his private parts were still as small as a silkworm. Everyone far and near learned of this by rumor, so no one would offer him their daughters to marry. Facing the possibility of being denied descendents, Fu fretted about it day and night, but didn’t know what he could do.\n\nLian meanwhile was studying with a teacher. When the teacher unexpectedly had to step out one day, it happened that a monkey show was playing just beyond their gate, and Lian went outside to watch, abandoning his studies. Upon reflecting that the teacher must be about to return, he became afraid of being punished, and ran off.\n\nOnce he was several _li_ from home, he saw a girl dressed in white, walking ahead of him, with a maidservant. The girl turned her head towards him, revealing that she was bewitchingly beautiful, beyond compare. She was walking slowly with her tiny feet, so Lian hurriedly walked past her.\n\nThe girl turned to look at her maidservant, and said, “Why don’t you try to ask the gentleman whether he’ll be traveling to Hainan?” The maid servant then called out the question. Lian asked why she was wondering.\n\n“If you’re going to Hainan,” the girl replied, “there’s a letter I’d like to send home with you. My mother would be a grateful hostess.” When Lian originally ran off, he did so without a particular direction in mind, so he decided that crossing the sea might be the thing to do, and gave the girl his consent. She took out the letter and gave it to her maidservant, who in turn gave it to Lian.\n\nWhen he asked the girl for her name and home town, she replied, “My family name is Hua, and we live outside Qinnü village, three or four _li_ from the northern part of Qiongzhou.” Lian then went aboard a boat and departed.\n\nThe sun was already setting as he arrived in northern Qiongzhou. He asked about Qinnü village, but no one seemed to know of the place. Heading to the north, he walked four or five _li_, and though the moon and stars were shining brilliantly, the road was so overgrown with grass, and the place was so wild, that he couldn’t find an inn where he might rest. He felt completely bewildered.\n\nHe noticed a tomb by the side of the road, so he thought he’d stop there to rest a bit, even though he was afraid that there might be tigers and wolves about. Consequently, he clambered up into a tree as nimbly as a monkey and settled onto a branch. He listened to the sounds of rustling in the tall pine trees, and to the chirping of insects in the night, which made him feel uneasy, so he regretted having impetuously agreed to come.\n\nSuddenly hearing the sounds of people below him, he looked down and saw what seemed to be a courtyard; a beauty was sitting on a stone, flanked by a pair of maidservants carrying painted lanterns, standing on each side to wait on her. The beauty turned to the maid on her left and said, “Tonight the moon is bright, outshining the stars, so we can take out the tea Auntie Hua gave me and make a cup of it to drink, while appreciating this lovely evening.” Lian assumed them to be ghosts or evil spirits, which made his hair stand on end, and he hardly dared take a breath.\n\nOne of the maidservants looked up at him all of a sudden and cried, “There’s someone in the tree!”\n\nThe frightened girl stood up and said, “What a brave fellow, to spy on people in the dark!”\n\nLian was horrified, but with no place to run and hide, he climbed down, prostrated himself on the ground, and begged her to pardon him. When the beauty came over to take a casual look at him, her anger turned to pleasure—she pulled him up and sat him down next to her. With a sidelong glance, Lian could make out that she was seventeen or eighteen years old, and stunningly gorgeous. When he listened to her speak, he could tell she had a local accent.\n\nShe asked him, “What are you doing here?”\n\n“I’ve been sent to take a letter to someone,” he replied.\n\nShe informed him, “There are many bandits in the countryside, so sleeping out in the open can be risky. If you don’t mind the clutter, I’d like you to rest here.” Then she invited Lian inside.\n\nThere was a room with only one bed in it, so she directed a maidservant to spread out two quilts on it for them. Since Lian was ashamed of his physical inadequacy, he offered to sleep on the floor. The girl laughed and said, “Having received our honored guest, how dare I neglect tending to you?” Lian couldn’t get out of it, so he laid down together with her on the bed, though he was so mortified that he didn’t have the nerve to relax and stretch out.\n\nSoon afterwards, the girl secretly slipped her hand in under Lian’s quilt to explore, lightly stroking his thigh. Lian pretended to be asleep, like he hadn’t felt anything. Then, a little while later, she lifted his quilt and slid under it, nudging him, though he still showed no reaction. The girl slid her hand down to his private parts. Then, disappointed, she stopped stroking, quietly slid out from under the quilt, and left. Presently, Lian heard the sound of weeping. Feeling nervous and humiliated, uncertain what to do, he cursed heaven for his deficiency.\n\nThe beauty called for her maidservant to bring a light. The maid saw signs of tears on the beauty’s face, and asked in surprise what was making her unhappy. The girl shook her head and replied, “I’m just sighing over my destiny.” The maid stood before the bed and looked searchingly into the girl’s face. The beauty said, “If you can wake him up, send him on his way.” Lian heard all this, which doubled his feelings of shame; in addition, he worried about finding a place to stay in the middle of the night.\n\nWhile he was thinking things over, the maid declared, “Auntie Hua’s come.”\n\nLian took a quick peek, and saw that she was in her fifties, though still very stylish. When Auntie Hua saw that the girl wasn’t asleep, she asked why. The beauty refused to reply. Then the woman noticed there was someone lying on the bed, and demanded, “Who’s that sharing your bed?”\n\n“This evening a young gentleman asked for lodging,” the maid answered for the girl.\n\nAuntie Hua laughed and said, “I didn’t realize Qiaoniang was celebrating her wedding.” When she noticed that Qiaoniang’s tears hadn’t yet dried, she was startled, and said, “Tears have no place on one’s wedding night; has the gentleman been rough with you?”\n\nQiaoniang said nothing, sobbing all the more. Auntie Hua wanted to have a grope to examine the young man, but as she lifted his clothing, the letter fell onto the bed. She picked it up and looked at it, then cried in amazement, “This is my daughter’s handwriting!” She opened it up and read it, both sighing and exclaiming.\n\nQiaoniang asked her what it was. “It’s from Sanniang,” Auntie Hua explained, “who says that her husband Wu has died, leaving her alone with no place to go—so what’s she going to do?”\n\nThe girl replied, “This fellow said he had a letter to deliver, so it’s fortunate we hadn’t sent him away yet.” Auntie Hua told him to get up, then inquired as to how he came by the letter. Lian carefully explained. Auntie Hua replied, “You’ve gone to a lot of trouble to bring this letter, so how can we recompense you?” She gave him a searching look, and asked with a laugh, “How have you managed to upset Qiaoniang?”\n\nLian answered, “I don’t know what I’ve done.” Then she asked Qiaoniang her question.\n\nThe girl sighed and explained, “I’m upset at myself for having married a eunuch when I was alive, and for not running away from the fate of having another eunuch, that’s why.”\n\nAuntie Hua turned to Lian and declared, “Clever boy—unaware that you’re really a woman, I thought you were a man, eh? You’re my guest, so for a bit let’s not bother the others.”\n\nThen she conducted him into one of the rooms on the east corridor, and slid her hand into his pants to examine him. Laughing, she said, “It’s no surprise that Qiaoniang’s all in tears. However, you’re lucky that there’s a physical foundation, so it can still be fortified.” She held up a lamp and scavenged through her chests and baskets, till she came across a black pill that she told Lian to swallow down at once, mysteriously ordering him not to move, and then went out. Lian lay there musing by himself, not knowing what disease the medicine was supposed to remedy.\n\nJust as the fifth watch was beginning, he became conscious of feeling a moist warmth just below his navel, directly going into his private parts, suffusing the area until there was something hanging down between his thighs; when he touched himself, he found an impressive male organ. He was shocked and ecstatic, like he’d been awarded the highest distinction imaginable from the emperor.\n\nAs daylight spilled over the windowsills, Auntie Hua entered, carrying steamed cakes into the room for him, warning him to sit still, and upon leaving, shut the door behind her. She went and told Qiaoniang, “Since the young man performed a worthy deed by delivering the letter, we need to detain him until Sanniang arrives, so they can get to know each other, like elder and younger sisters. For the time being, keep him shut up in there so we can avoid upsetting or annoying anyone.” Then she walked out the door and departed.\n\nLian was pacing in boredom, every so often opening the door a crack, like a bird peeking out of its cage. He spotted Qiaoniang, and felt the urge to summon her so he could display himself to her, but was too bashful and stopped himself. He was involved thus till about midnight, when Auntie Hua brought her daughter home.\n\nShe opened his door and remarked, “The gentleman must be very bored! Sanniang, come here and formally thank him.” The girl from his road encounter shyly entered, then turned to face Lian, and greeted him respectfully. Auntie Hua directed them to call each other elder brother and younger sister.\n\nQiaoniang giggled and said, “They can also call each other elder sister and younger sister.” They all went together into the main room, where the group sat together while wine was served.\n\nAs they were drinking, Qiaoniang teasingly asked Lian, “Are eunuchs also aroused by beautiful women?”\n\n“The lame never forget what it’s like to have walked,” Lian replied, “and the blind never forget what it’s like to have seen.” They all smiled broadly at his words.\n\nQiaoniang noticed that Sanniang was fatigued from traveling, so she forced her to go to bed. Auntie Hua then gave Sanniang a glance to indicate that she should go and sleep with Lian. Sanniang, embarrassed and nervous, wouldn’t move. Auntie Hua encouraged her, “This socalled man is actually a woman, so what’s there to be afraid of?” She urged the two to leave together.\n\nPrivately she advised Lian, “In secret, you’re my son-in-law; publicly, you’re my son—that’s the deal.”\n\nDelighted, Lian took Sanniang’s arm, and led her onto his bed, where it was like he was using a grindstone to test a new blade, and his pleasure was obvious. Once they were finished and resting on pillows, he asked her, “What kind of person is Qiaoniang?”\n\n“She’s a ghost,” Sanniang answered. “Her talent and looks are unequalled, but it’s her fate to suffer misfortune. She married a young gentleman of the Mao family, but he was impotent, and by the age of eighteen he still couldn’t function, so she became depressed and moribund, till the regret she harbored sent her to her grave.”\n\nLian was shocked and began to suspect that Sanniang, too, was a ghost. “To tell you the truth,” she said, “I’m not a ghost, but a fox. Qiaoniang was living alone without a mate, while I and my mother had no home, so we took advantage of the situation to settle here.” Lian was quite stunned. Sanniang told him, “Don’t worry, we may be ghosts and foxes, but we won’t cause you any misfortune.”\n\nHenceforth, they chatted and ate together every day. Though Lian knew Qiaoniang wasn’t human, yet he loved her for her beauty and goodness, and his sole regret was that he hadn’t had an opportunity to expose himself to her. Lian was cultured and restrained, yet good at pleasing people by telling them jokes, so Qiaoniang began to feel affection for him.\n\nOne day, as Auntie Hua and Sanniang were about to go out, they shut Lian up again in his room. Lian sulked, pacing the room in circles, and calling through the door to Qiaoniang. Qiaoniang ordered a maidservant to try out several keys, then finally got the door open. Lian leaned close to her ear and asked her to come in with him. Qiaoniang sent the maidservant away.\n\nLian then pulled her close to him on the bed, snuggling face to face with her. Qiaoniang mockingly reached down below his navel with both hands, and said, “It’s a pity that this part of my boyfriend is lost.” She hadn’t even finished these words before she found her hands absolutely full.\n\nAstonished, she exclaimed, “What was so tiny last time, is suddenly huge!”\n\nLian laughed as he told her, “Last time it was too shy to come out for a visitor, so it remained shrunken; now with all the embarrassing ridicule and slander, it grew bigger, just like a frog when it gets angry.” Then they made love together.\n\nWhen they were finished, Qiaoniang angrily exclaimed, “Now I know why they’ve kept your door shut. Before, when mother and daughter were drifting without a place to stay, they availed themselves of my home. Sanniang learned to embroider from me, and I never kept even the smallest secret from her. For her to act like this now out of jealousy—!”\n\nLian calmed her down, and explained what had happened. Qiaoniang finally relented. “It’s a secret,” Lian said, “and Auntie Hua urged me to keep it that way.” He’d just finished speaking, when Auntie Hua suddenly entered. The two, surprised, leapt out of bed.\n\nThe woman cast an angry eye, and demanded, “Who opened his door?” With a smile, Qiaoniang admitted she was responsible. This made Auntie Hua even more furious, prompting a stream of curses from her.\n\nQiaoniang just laughed, and exclaimed, “Granny, what a big laugh! This is a man who’s really a woman, so what use can he possibly be?” Sanniang, upset from observing the acerbic exchange between her mother and Qiaoniang, tried to intervene between the two, and finally managed to turn their stubborn anger into amity. While Qiaoniang’s words still seemed resentful and resistant, subsequently she recognized Sanniang’s intention and cooperated with her. But Auntie Hua remained vigilant day and night, so the two lovers had no chance to act on their desires for each other, and could only express their emotions through significant glances.\n\nOne day, Auntie Hua told Lian, “My two daughters—the elder sister and the younger sister—are now both devoted to you. I’ve been thinking that your staying here may be improper, so you should return home and explain things to your father and mother, towards concluding a marriage agreement.” She immediately made preparations for him, and hurried him to leave.\n\nTogether, the two girls faced him with sorrowful expressions; but Qiaoniang looked especially distraught, her tears spilling like the pearls from a broken necklace, and this went on for quite some time. Auntie Hua tried to stop them from crying, and at her earliest opportunity pulled Lian outside. Once they stepped outside the gate, the house and grounds ceased to exist, and in their place Lian saw an untended grave.\n\nAuntie Hua accompanied him till he was aboard a boat, and told him, “Once you’ve gone, I’ll take my two daughters away and rent a house in your village. If you won’t forget your beloveds, go to the abandoned garden of the Li family, and there you can claim them for marrying.” Lian then returned home.\n\nAfter Lian’s father had searched for his son unsuccessfully, he was naturally apprehensive, so when he saw his son return home, he was overjoyed. Lian outlined the whole story, and described Auntie Hua’s plan. “How can you trust that fiend’s words?” demanded his father. “The only reason you’re still alive is your male deficiency; otherwise, you’d be dead!”\n\n“Even though they’re supernatural beings,” Lian countered, “they have feelings just like people do; besides, the girls are both intelligent and lovely, and if I marry them, I won’t receive any more teasing from our relatives.” His father had nothing to say, and simply sneered at him. Lian then left, but he found himself itching to show off his new ability again, so he began making love often to the maidservants; eventually, he even began doing it publicly in the daytime, just because he wanted to scandalize his parents.\n\nOne day, a young maidservant happened to spy him doing it, and ran off to tell his mother. Since she didn’t believe her, she went to have a peek for herself and was astonished. She summoned the maids to get to the bottom of the matter, and hence she learned the whole story.\n\nEcstatically happy, she exuberantly announced to everyone she met that her son wasn’t sexually incapable, and that they would soon choose a daughter from among the influential families for her son to marry. Lian told his mother confidentially, “I’ll marry into the Hua family, or I won’t marry at all.”\n\nHis mother remarked, ““There’s no shortage of beautiful women in the world, so why settle on some spirit?”\n\n“If not for Auntie Hua,” he answered, “I’d never have been able to perform sexually. It would be inauspicious to turn my back on them.” His father was persuaded, so he sent a servant and an old woman to go and look at Auntie Hua and her daughters discreetly.\n\nThe two traveled four or five _li_ east of the city wall, looking for the Li family garden. Among some collapsed walls, bamboo, and trees, they saw the wispy signs of kitchen fire smoke. The old woman climbed down from the carriage, and walked right up to the door, where Auntie Hua and Sanniang were wiping the table and washing up, as though they were waiting for someone.\n\nThe old woman paid her respects, and then revealed her master’s orders. Upon looking at Sanniang, she declared in surprise, “Is this the lady our young master would bring into the family? When I see her, I can understand why young master’s spirit yearns for her, and why his dreams revolve around her.” Then she asked about Qiaoniang.\n\nAuntie Hua sighed, and said, “She’s my adopted daughter. Three days ago, she suddenly passed away.” Then she entertained the old woman and the servant with wine and food.\n\nWhen the old woman returned home, she gave an account of Sanniang’s demeanor that pleased both father and mother. When she got around to news of Qiaoniang’s death, Lian was so grief-sticken that he sobbed and sobbed.\n\nThe night of the wedding ceremony, Lian met with Auntie Hua to ask her about Qiaoniang. She told him, “She’s already been reborn in the northern lands.” Lian cried for a long while.\n\nHe took Sanniang home with him, but in the end he couldn’t forget his love for Qiaoniang, and whenever anyone arrived from Hainan, he was certain to ask them in, to interview them about her. Someone said that at the Qinnü graveyard by night, one could hear a ghost weeping. Lian was surprised at this, and ran in to tell Sanniang.\n\nSanniang sat deep in thought for a good long time, then, bursting into tears, exclaimed, “I’ve abandoned my elder sister!” Lian asked her what she meant, and she explained, “When my mother and I came here, we didn’t let her know the plan. This suffering spirit, couldn’t it be her? I’ve wanted to tell you, but was afraid of being scolded by my mother.”\n\nLian listened, saddened, but then became hopeful. He ordered a carriage and traveled at double speed day and night, hurrying to the site of Qiaoniang’s grave. He kowtowed at her grave tablet, and cried out, “Qiaoniang! Qiaoniang! I’m here.”\n\nInstantly, he saw Qiaoniang, carrying a baby in her arms as she emerged from the grave, raise her head and piteously sob, staring unstintingly at him with anguished regret. Lian also wept. When he inquired whose child it was, Qiaoniang replied, “This is your son, born three months ago.”\n\nLian sighed, and said, “Because I believed Auntie Hua’s lies, the suffering of mother and son has been been hidden away in a grave—what a wrong I have to rectify!” Then he took them away in his carriage, crossed the sea, and returned home.\n\nHe held the baby in his arms as he told his mother everything. When she saw the child with its sturdy appearance, not like a ghost at all, she was exceedingly pleased. Qiaoniang and Sanniang lived harmoniously, and were filial daughters to Lian’s mother and father.\n\nAfterwards, Lian’s father fell ill, so they sent for a doctor to come. But Qiaoniang told them, “His sickness can’t be cured, because his spirit has already left him.” She supervised as they prepared for his funeral, and as soon as they were finished, he died.\n\nThe child grew up to resemble his father quite remarkably; he proved particularly adept, and at fourteen, he passed the examination for _xiucai_.\n\nOld Zi Xia, from Gaoyou (though he moved to Guangdong), heard all this. He’s lost track of what the place was called, and he also doesn’t know how everything turned out in the end.",

Wu’s customs treasured the city god so greatly, that the people carved a wooden effigy of it, and dressed it in brocade, which made it look alive.\n\nFor the god’s birthday, the local residents would all collect money and throw a festival party, during which an imperial carriage drawn by men would parade through their thoroughfare; they constructed a series of banners, then organized all kinds of officials into rows and lines to parade together, accompanied by musicians and the sound of drums.\n\nThe event was treated as a custom, so for years no one had dared not to participate.\n\nThe official, who had just come to take up his new post, came across the celebration, and stopped to ask what was going on. Some of the Wu residents explained it to him. He asked further questions, and learned how much they were spending on the lavish displays.\n\nOutraged, the official pointed to their deity and scolded them, “The city god is supposed to serve the city. If it is too ignorant to cast its magic, or if it’s just some disgusting ghost, then it doesn’t deserve to be worshipped; even if it’s a useful spirit, it should make economical use of resources and manpower—isn’t it counter-productive to spend money on it, raised from collecting the residents’ possessions?” When he’d finished speaking, he set the effigy on the ground and gave it twenty lashes.\n\nFollowing this, the elaborate custom was abandoned. The upright and just official was never secretive about his public practices, but he’d also enjoyed such celebrations when he was a young man.\n\nOnce he’d occupied his office for some years, he was outside his office building, climbing a ladder to look into a bird nest, when he unexpectedly missed his footing and fell down, breaking his hip and subsequently dying. The people heard the official’s loud voice angrily arguing with the city god from inside the city god’s temple, and he carried on thus for several days without stopping.\n\nWu’s people hadn’t forgotten the official’s virtuousness, so a crowd gathered to discuss a solution to this conflict, then they built another temple for the official, and the sounds of the argument finally ceased. This temple was also dedicated to the city god, with sacrifices offered there year round, and consequently the god’s influence seemed particularly manifest there. Wu since then has had two city god temples, they say."

A person came to her for a diagnosis, but the woman explained she couldn’t offer a prescription herself—she had to wait until sunset, when she could ask for the advice of various spirits.\n\nThat evening, she thoroughly cleaned her small room, then shut herself up inside. A crowd gathered outside her door and window, quietly pressing their ears close to listen in, but they couldn’t catch any words, though no one dared even cough. Inside and out, everything came to a dead stop.\n\nAbout halfway through the evening watches, suddenly they heard the sound of a curtain being pulled open. From inside, the woman asked, “Have you come, Ninth Aunt?”\n\n“I have come,” replied a woman’s voice.\n\nThe woman again asked, “Has Lamei come with Ninth Aunt?”\n\nWhat seemed to be the voice of a maidservant replied, “I’m here.” The voices of the three became intermingled in incessant chatter, on and on without a lull.\n\nPresently, they heard the sound of curtain hooks being pulled again, and the woman announced, “Sixth Aunt has come.” The other woman’s voice asked, “Has Chunmei also come, cradling the young master in her arms?”\n\nAnother female voice declared, “The stubborn little rascal! Wailing and refusing to go to sleep, yet he insisted on coming with his mama. He must weigh a hundred _jun_; I’m so tired of carrying him on my back, the little goblin!” Before long, they heard the sounds of Chunmei’s courteous greetings, of Ninth Aunt asking about others, of Sixth Aunt exchanging greetings, of the two maidservants expressing their appreciation, of the little boy’s merry laughter, and of a cat, blending into a noisy clamor.\n\nThen they heard the woman say, “The little gentleman really loves to play, since he came from so far away, holding that kitty all the while.”\n\nLater on, the sounds gradually hushed, and at the sound of the curtains being drawn again, the room erupted with voices inquiring, “Fourth Aunt, why have you come so late?”\n\nA small, delicate voice answered, “The road here is longer than a thousand _li_, and it took a while for mother-in-law and I to walk it. Besides, she walks rather slowly.” Then each of them, in their own ways, greeted Fourth Aunt and her mother-in-law warmly, combining the sound of seats being moved and calls for additional seating, the noise filling the room for the length of time it would take to have a meal.\n\nThen they heard the woman ask about someone’s ailment. Ninth Aunt believed that ginseng should be given, Sixth Aunt felt that it would be best to prescribe milk vetch, while Fourth Aunt suggested applying some atractylodes. The voices consulted for a while, then they heard Ninth Aunt call for a brush and inkstone.\n\nBefore long, there came the shuffling of paper being folded, the clatter of the writing brush’s cap being pulled off and tossed down, and the scraping of the inkstone to make ink; then when the brush was dropped onto the table, it made a rattling sound, and they heard the rustling of medicinal herbs being combined and wrapped up.\n\nAn instant later, the woman emerged, calling for the sick person, so she could explain the use of the remedy and the prescription. Then when she turned and went back inside, they heard the three Aunts taking their leave, the three maidservants saying their farewells, the child’s incoherent mumbling, and the cat’s meows, all at the same time. Ninth Aunt’s voice was clear and penetrating, Sixth Aunt’s slow and elderly, Fourth Aunt’s delicate and pleasing, and along with the voices of the three maids, each had a unique tone that could easily be identified and distinguished by anyone listening.\n\nThe astounded crowd took them to be authentic spirit voices. But when they tested her prescriptions later, they proved not to be very effective. Thus they were party to what is known as ventriloquism, an unusual skill used there to sell medicine. Still and all, pretty rare!\n\nWang Xinyi once reported that when he was in the capital, passing through the market district, he heard the sound of a stringed instrument accompanying a singer, and people watching, blocking the way like a wall.\n\nAs he got close enough to catch a peek, he saw a young man with a lovely voice singing a song. But there was no instrument accompanying him—only his finger pressed against his cheek while he sang, sometimes pressing it in, sometimes pulling it out; it sounded no different than the vibrations of a bow string. He was also a descendant of practitioners of ventriloquism.",

        "body": "The Li family owned a second home in Wei county. Unexpectedly, an old man came to them to lease the residence, guaranteeing faithfully to pay them fifty taels a year for it. Li agreed to rent it to him. After he’d left, however, there was no more news of him, so Mr. Li advised his servants to rent the place to someone else.\n\nThe next day after they did so, the old man showed up and said to him, “You agreed to lease the residence to me, so why are you about to switch and rent it to someone else?” Li then explained his doubts. The old man replied, “I intend to be in the house for a long time; I was delayed, then, because I had to choose an auspicious time to move in, which will arrive after ten more days.” Proceeding to pay a year’s rent up front, he remarked, “Even if in the end it seems unoccupied for the year, don’t become concerned.” Li accompanied him out, inquiring about the date, and the old man told it to him.\n\nSeveral days past that date, there was still no sign of him moving in. Li then went to take a look for himself, but found the pair of gates bolted from the inside, smoke emerging from the kitchen chimney, and miscellaneous sounds of people inside. Surprised, he sent in his visiting card, offering to pay his respects.\n\nThe old man hurried out and ushered him inside, laughing and chatting with him like he was family. Once Li returned home, he sent some people back to present gifts from his family; the old man graciously and generously rewarded them with food, drink, and other nice things.\n\nAfter another several days, Li set up a banquet, invited the old man, and they merrily continued their happy conversations. When Li asked him about his birthplace, he identified it as Qinzhong. Li expressed surprise that he was so far from home. The old man explained, “Your county here is a most fortunate place. Qinzhong can no longer be home to me, for a great catastrophe is about to befall it.” At that time, peace prevailed everywhere, so Li didn’t question him any further.\n\nThe following day, the old man sent him an invitation, announcing that he was ready to repay his landlord’s courtesy, providing décor, drinks, and food that were lavish and elegant. Li, amazed by it all, began to wonder whether his tenant was actually an influential official. The old man was on such close terms with him that he informed Li he was a fox. Li was so astonished at this that he mentioned it to everyone he came across.\n\nCounty officials who heard about the strange affair came in their carriages daily to the old man’s gate, hoping for a chance to meet and to make friends with him, and without exception he kindly agreed to see them. It was just a matter of time before higher officials also began showing up there. Only one particular county magistrate was repeatedly refused and forced to take his leave. The magistrate solicited Li’s help in gaining him admission, but still the old man refused to see him.\n\nLi asked him what was up. The old man left his seat and came near Li, whispering, “You wouldn’t know this, but in a previous life he was an ass, though he’s now the magistrate passing judgment on the people, and is so greedy that even helping himself to somebody’s rice soup makes him drunk with power. I may not be human, but I’d feel ashamed to have him for a friend.”\n\nLi then made up an excuse to tell the magistrate that the fox feared his godlike nature, and hence simply didn’t dare see him. The magistrate believed him and stopped coming. This was in the eleventh year of Kangxi’s reign. Not long after, Shaanxi was afflicted by the fires of rebellion. This gives credence to the belief that foxes can foretell the future.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The ass is a large creature. When angered, it kicks out its legs and brays itself hoarse, its eyes larger than wine jars, till it’s snorting like an ox; not only is its noise unpleasant, but so is its appearance. If you hold up a bundle of hay, however, you can persuade it to lower its head in docile compliance, happy to accept a harness. If someone is a magistrate of the people with a character like this, he will become intoxicated with his authority even by taking someone’s rice soup. I hope that those who govern the people will caution themselves not to be like the ass, but instead to seek the counsel of the fox, thereby growing in virtue daily.”",

        "body": "In Guangping, old man Feng had a son named Xiangru. Father and son had both been successful in the initial level of the civil service examination. The old man was nearly sixty, upright and honest, yet his family was so poor that the cupboards were often bare.\n\nOver the course of a number of years, old Feng’s wife and Xiangru’s wife both died, one after the other, so all of the housework, from fetching water from the well, to cooking their rice, fell upon the two men.\n\nOne night as Xiangru was sitting under the moon, he suddenly caught a glimpse of his neighbor woman from the east side, peeking over the wall, so he went up to the wall to look at her. When he got a better glimpse, he discovered that she was beautiful. He came closer, uttering a small chuckle. He beckoned to her with his hand to come nearer, but she wouldn’t move. He insistently invited her, and then, when he put a ladder up, she climbed over and afterwards they went to bed together.\n\nWhen he asked what her name was, she replied, “I’m your neighbor, Hongyu.” Xiangru was lovestruck, and swore he would love her forever. Hongyu promised the same. Night after night she came and went, with the assignations continuing for about six months.\n\nOn one occasion, old Feng got up during the night, heard his son exchanging witty comments with someone, and then when he stole a peek, he saw the girl there. Furious, he loudly swore, “You animal, how dare you behave this way! Though we’re so poor, you’re learning to be a playboy rather than studying as hard as you can? If people find out about this, you’ll lose your reputation; even if they don’t know about it, it’ll ruin your life!” Xiangru fell to his knees, tearfully expressing how sorry he was.\n\nHis father then rebuked Hongyu, “You haven’t obeyed the rules for female morality. Since you didn’t guard your own reputation, you’ve already disgraced yourself, but now you’re disgracing other people. In this case, your lack of restraint has brought shame on my house!” When he finished his tirade, he angrily went back to bed.\n\nHongyu’s tears fell as she cried, “Your father blamed you so heartily that I feel terribly ashamed! We two must be destined to end like this!”\n\n“Since my father is still alive,” Xiangru replied, “I cannot freely make my own decision about this. But we’re so deeply in love with each other, we should just keep it as our secret.”\n\nAs Hongyu took her leave to part from him, Xiangru began to weep. She stopped and told him, “Since our relationship didn’t result from a matchmaker, or from our parents’ decision, and was just a matter of me coming over the wall to get together with you, how can we expect it to last until we die? There’ll be a nice marriage waiting for you somewhere here, so you can go and make a proposal.” Xiangru informed her that he was penniless. She replied, “I’ll come tomorrow night and help you find a solution.”\n\nLater, the next night, Hongyu appeared as she promised, took out forty silver taels, and presented them to Xiangru. She explained, “If you travel sixty _li_, you’ll come to Wu village and Mr. Wei, who values his eighteen-yearold daughter so highly that he hasn’t married her off. But if you offer him enough money, he’ll certainly agree to it.” As soon as she finished speaking, she left.\n\nXiangru seized the opportunity to tell his father that he wished to go look for a prospective wife. But he hid the silver and didn’t venture to tell him about it. The old man was concerned that since they were penniless, there was no use in pursuing the matter, so he would have stopped him. Xiangru then gently remarked, “I’d like to try it first, before giving up.” The old man nodded his assent.\n\nBorrowing someone’s horse and a servant, Xiangru went to pay his respects to Mr. Wei. Wei turned out to be the head of a farming family. Xiangru called out his name, then was led to speak with him. Wei knew that Xiangru belonged to a distinguished family, and seeing that his bearing and expression were open and clear, found him to be admirable, but worried that Xiangru didn’t have enough money to get married.\n\nSensing this in Wei’s hemming and hawing, Xiangru poured all the taels in his bag out on the table. Wei, then quite pleased, called upon a neighbor to serve as witness, and in a book with red pages, recorded the marriage agreement.\n\nXiangru went inside to pay his respects to Wei’s wife. In a narrow room, the daughter shyly held a welcome banner for her mother. He took a cursory glance at her, and although she was simply dressed, she seemed so radiantly beautiful that he was secretly delighted.\n\nWei then welcomed Xiangru as his son-in-law, and said, “There’s really no need for a formal ceremony, son. Wait a little, while the wedding clothes are made, then when that’s done, I’ll send my daughter to your house.” Xiangru set up a time with him and then left for home.\n\nHe fibbed to old Feng, telling him that Wei cherished their family’s reputation, and wasn’t demanding any money from them. The old man was quite pleased. When the appointed day arrived, Wei sent his daughter as promised. The girl, hardworking and thrifty, made a virtue of docility, and very earnestly worked for marital harmony.\n\nAfter two years, they had a boy, named Fu’er. On the occasion of Tomb-Sweeping Day, they were carrying the infant up to a grave site, when they met a gentleman named Song. Official Song, an imperial censor who had been dismissed from his office for taking bribes, lived brashly in the community.\n\nOn that day, after also visiting a grave, Song returned home after having seen the beautiful lady. He asked a villager about her and learned that she was Xiangru’s wife. Counting on the fact that the Fengs were impoverished scholars, he hoped to seduce them with a large bribe into wavering and sending the wife over to him, to use as he wished.\n\nWhen Xiangru happened to hear about this, he became livid with anger; but since he thought he couldn’t oppose Song’s power, he covered his anger with a laugh, and returned home to tell his father.\n\nInfuriated, old Feng rushed out to inform Song’s servants, gesturing wildly, berating Song with a wide variety of curses. Song’s servants scattered like rats.\n\nSong was also angry, seething like a boiling cauldron, so he ended up sending several people to Xiangru’s house, to beat up old Feng and his son. When Xiangru’s wife heard them, she abandoned Fu’er in bed, her hair all disheveled, and wailed for help. The mob grabbed the woman, boisterously dragged her off, and then left.\n\nFather and son lay wounded and disabled, groaning on the ground, while Fu’er was choking and crying from in his room. The neighbors took pity on the Fengs, and helped them onto their beds. As the days went by, Xiangru was able to get out of bed with a cane. But his father was so angry that he couldn’t eat, vomited blood, and soon died.\n\nXiangru howled in sorrow, and with Fu’er in his arms, he went to the governor to file a complaint—and though the lawsuit went all the way to the highest provincial officer, in the end he received no justice. Afterward, he heard that his wife had refused to give in to Song and had consequently died, exacerbating his sorrow.\n\nHis many wrongs choked his chest and throat, but he saw no way out. Every time he thought of his desire to find a way to kill Song, he recalled that Song was surrounded by servants, making it hard to get to him, and besides, his infant son would have no one to care for him. He grieved day and night, unable even to close his eyes.\n\nSuddenly, an impressively virile fellow with curly beard and broad jaw, whom Xiangru had never met before, appeared in his room to console him. He invited the man to have a seat and asked him about his family background. The man hastily demanded, “Don’t you want revenge on the enemy who killed your father and viciously forced your wife?”\n\nXiangru suspected him to be one of Song’s people come to spy on him, so he knowingly falsified his answer. The stranger’s eyes angrily bulged in their sockets as he exclaimed, “I thought you were a true gentleman before, but now it’s clear that one doesn’t have to be lowborn to be contemptible!”\n\nXiangru sensed that he wasn’t a spy after all, fell to his knees, and drew near the stranger, declaring, “I was honestly afraid that you were one of Song’s people. Now I’ll let you know my thoughts: I’ve been concealing my hatred, waiting on a chance for revenge for quite some time. However, I’ve got to protect my infant son, or I fear our family line will die out. You’re a righteous person, so can you take my place as his guardian?”\n\n“That’s women’s business,” the stranger replied, “not something I can do. You know how to raise an infant, so please take care of that yourself, and I will work faithfully on your behalf.” When Xiangru heard this, he threw himself down and touched his forehead to the ground in gratitude. The stranger left without turning around to look at him.\n\nXiangru chased after him to inquire his name, and he answered, “I won’t tell you my name, and thus if I’m unsuccessful, you won’t have my name to blame; if successful, you won’t have to worry about thanking me.” Then he left. Xiangru was afraid of being involved in the pending violence, so he took Fu’er in his arms and fled.\n\nThat night, as the entire Song household was sleeping, someone climbed over several house walls and entered, killed the imperial censor, his father, son, daughter-in-law, and a maidservant. The Song family put charges against Xiangru in writing, and then informed the local officials. The officials were utterly astonished. The local official sent his people to capture Xiangru, but found no trace of him, which effectively implicated him as the apparent murderer.\n\nMeanwhile, Song’s servants and the official’s followers hunted everywhere for Xiangru and his son. When night fell on the southern mountains, they heard an infant’s crying and tracked Xiangru’s footprints, seized the two of them, and dragged them back. As Fu’er began to cry more and more, the captors grew so angry that they grabbed the child away and cast him aside. Xiangru, maddened by this injustice, wanted to die.\n\nWhen the city commander saw him, he demanded, “Why’d you murder them?”\n\nXiangru cried, “I’ve been framed! He died during the night, but I left the village during the daytime—and besides, I was holding a crying baby in my arms, so how could I have climbed over the walls to kill people?”\n\nThe commander insisted, “If you didn’t kill anyone, why’d you run away?” Xiangru was unable to argue successfully in his own defense. Then the officials put him in jail.\n\nXiangru, sobbing, cried, “It doesn’t matter if I die, but what was my baby’s crime?”\n\n“You murdered others’ children; your child was killed,” the commander replied, “so what’s your complaint?” Xiangru, who had already been stripped in the commander’s office, and had been repeatedly subjected to cruel punishment, refused to confess any guilt on his part.\n\nThat evening, the commander had just laid down when he heard something strike his bed, followed by a shaking, which frightened him greatly as he felt it. He shouted out, and the whole household was awakened into springing up and gathering lights, revealing thereby a short sword, as keenly sharp as frost, which had penetrated the wood of his bed more than a _cun_ and couldn’t be pulled free. When the commander saw it, he lost all spirit.\n\nPeople with weapons searched all over in the vicinity of the house, but could find no traces of anyone. The commander was frightened out of his mind. He considered that Song was already dead, and hence he had nothing to fear from him; he described everything in detail, reporting to a higher official, and pleading for Xiangru until he was cleared of blame and finally released from jail.\n\nXiangru returned home, where there was no rice in the clay pot, alone among the shadows of his four walls. Fortunately, his neighbors took pity on him and brought him food and drink, since he was neglecting his own needs. Thinking about how his great enemy had been repaid, he would suddenly burst into loud laughter; then considering the cruel misfortunes that had virtually exterminated his family, his tears would fall without cease; thinking about it the least bit reminded Xiangru that he was poor to the bone, and that his family line would not continue, so he found a place where no one was around and wept loudly, unable to stop himself from crying. He was like this for half a year, trapped and increasingly disengaged.\n\nThen he begged the city commander for pity, and asked to have the body of his wife returned to him. After burying her and returning home, sad and grieving, wanting to die, he tossed and turned in his empty bed, but there was just no relief for him.\n\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door, and as he concentrated his attention on being very still and on listening, he heard someone outside the door murmuring words to a child. Xiangru anxiously got up and covertly peered out at what seemed to be a woman. As soon as he opened the door, she exclaimed, “With so much injustice to be redressed, it’s fortunate that you’re not sick!” The voice had a familiar sound, but on the spur of the moment, he couldn’t place it.\n\nWhen he brought a candle near, he saw it was Hongyu. She picked up a child, who’d been playing and laughing as she stood over him. Xiangru didn’t take the time to ask anything, he just embraced Hongyu and wept openly. The woman also shared his grief. Then she prodded the little boy and said, “Have you forgotten your father?” The child clung to Hongyu’s clothes, his bright eyes looking at Xiangru.\n\nHe carefully examined the boy till he recognized the blessing that it was his own Fu’er. Quite shocked, weeping, he asked, “How did my son come to be here?”\n\nHongyu replied, “I’ll tell you the truth: the former references to me as a neighbor woman were lies. I’m really a fox. Just as I was going out one night, I saw your son crying at the mouth of a valley, so I adopted him in Shaanxi province. When I heard the news that your great troubles had been settled, I brought him here so you could be reunited.” Xiangru wiped away his tears as he thanked her formally. Fu’er was nestled at Hongyu’s breast like she was his mother, but he couldn’t yet remember his father.\n\nJust before dawn, Hongyu hastily got up. When Xiangru asked what she was doing, she told him, “I was about to leave.” Xiangru abjectly knelt at the bedside, weeping, unable to look up at her. Hongyu smiled and said, “I tricked you before. Now that your family’s newly restored, we should get up earlier and work hard.” Hongyu began clearing away the wild grass that had grown up, working like a man.\n\nXiangru lamented that since he was so poor, he had no way to support them. “Please just concentrate on studying hard,” Hongyu replied. “I don’t know how much we’ll earn, but at least we won’t starve to death.” Then she took out money for him to purchase sewing supplies; she leased a field containing several plots of ten _mu_ each and hired servants to cultivate them. She worked very hard at the farming, and mended clothes in the house, as the normal routine for her days. The village folk heard of Hongyu’s kindness and generously offered their own assistance.\n\nIn about six months, things had begun to flourish, and Xiangru’s family was becoming wealthy. He told Hongyu, “From heaps of ashes, you have delivered into my empty hands a new lease on life. However, in one matter I’m still not secure, so how can I settle it?” She asked him to explain, and he replied, “The time for the civil service examination is already near, but I’m not registered to take it.”\n\nHongyu laughed and said, “I’m sending four taels to the official in charge, and your name is already on the examination record—if I’d waited until you’d said something, it would’ve been too late to make arrangements.” Xiangru put the money inside his sleeve.\n\nHe was a successful candidate in the imperial examination at the provincial level. By the time he was thirty-six years old, he owned fertile fields joined by footpaths, and a summer house that was large and spacious. Hongyu was so svelte that she seemed she might just blow away, yet she made an exceptional farm family wife, although the severe winters were harsh and the skin of her hands was smooth and soft like cream. It’s said that she was thirty-eight, but when people saw Hongru, they often took her for a woman of about twenty.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “His son was sturdy, his father virtuous, and hence he’s rewarded with a good ending. Not only was this man knightly in behavior; the fox was, too. It was also a pretty strange situation! The commander inaccurately judged things, inciting a frightening anger; and the shock of the blade as it entered the wood—couldn’t it have easily gone half a _chi_ higher into the bed? If Su Zimei had read this story, he would’ve declared something like, ‘What a shame it couldn’t just hit him!’”",

        "body": "Near the border of Beizhi, a dragon fell from the sky into a village. It moved ponderously and awkwardly, as it entered the home of a certain notable family. Their house couldn’t hold its enormous body, so it squeezed itself small and went inside. The family members all fled. It made its way clamorously to the upper floor, while the family fired a cannon to scare it away. Then the dragon went back outside.\n\nJust outside the door, there was a shallow puddle of dirty, stagnant water. The dragon jumped into it, rolling about and covering itself with mud, then leaped up into the air more than a _chi_ before falling back down. It lay coiled in the mud there for three days, with flies gathering all over its scaly hide. Suddenly there came a heavy rain, and when a thunderbolt flashed across the sky, the dragon disappeared.\n\nA scholar climbed Mt. Niu with some friends to enter the monastery there for a visit, and to look around. They noticed that in its rafters, on a yellow tile, there was a little snake coiled up, as thin and insignificant as an earthworm. All of a sudden, it began to wrap around the tile like a finger; then it looped around another circuit, like a belt. Everyone became frightened, realizing it must be a dragon, so the group hurried and began climbing down.\n\nJust as they got halfway down the mountain, they heard the sound of a thunderbolt, from inside the monastery, that shook the entire the mountain valley. Black clouds covered the sky like a shell, and a massive dragon emerged from inside them for a moment, then plunged back inside and vanished.\n\nIn the little village of Zhangqiu, there was a peasant woman who was out in the fields working when a fierce wind blew dust in her face. Some of it got into one of her eyes, and made it feel like there were grains of wheat in it, so she rubbed and puffed at it, but it still didn’t feel comfortable.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes and carefully looked around, her eye wasn’t hurt, but there was an expanse of red flesh that appeared between her eyeball and the flesh around it. Someone said, “This must be a hiberating dragon.” The woman was worried that she was going to die.\n\nAfter more than three months, while a torrential rain was falling from the sky, suddenly there came the sound of a huge thunderbolt, a flash, and the dragon was gone. The woman wasn’t harmed in the least.\n\nYuan Xuansi reports, “At Suzhou, a thunderbolt exploded out of the darkness. The people saw a dragon swoop down from the clouds, its scaly hide stretching as it moved, clutching in its talons a human head, the beard and eyebrows of which were clearly visible; a moment later, it went into a cloud and disappeared. In addition, they never heard that anyone had lost his head.”",

        "title": "Fourth Lady Lin",
        "body": "In Qingzhou administrative district, there was an official named Chen Baoyue, from Fujian. One night, he was sitting by himself, when a woman pulled aside the curtain and entered. He looked at her, but didn’t recognize her; yet she was stunningly beautiful, and her long sleeves were in the style of the serving ladies of the imperial palace. She smiled and said, “Isn’t it lonely to sit here by yourself in the still of the night?”\n\nStartled, Chen demanded, “Who are you?”\n\n“My home’s not far from here,” she replied, “as close as your neighbor to the west.” Chen figured her for a ghost, but he felt attracted to her. He clutched at her sleeve and pulled her down next to him, where her refined conversation delighted him greatly. When he embraced her, she did little to resist.\n\nShe turned to look around her, and asked, “There isn’t anyone else here, is there?”\n\nChen anxiously closed the door and answered, “No one.” When he encouraged her to take off her skirt, she turned out to be very shy. Chen eagerly offered his assistance.\n\n“I’m twenty years old, though still a virgin,” she said. “If you’re too violent with me, I won’t be able to bear it.” When they finished making love, they noticed she’d bled a little, which made the mattress wet.\n\nThen, as they lay on the bed exchanging bed talk, she told him she was “Fourth Lady Lin.” Chen pressed her for details. She explained, “Though all my life I’ve been chaste, now because of your wanton act, I’ve lost my virginity. If you truly love me, just wish that we can love each other forever—why bother asking so many questions?” Before long, the cock crowed, so she rose and left.\n\nFrom that time forward, she came every night. Each time, they conversed and drank together behind closed doors. Whenever their chats came to the topic of music, Lin could always dissect a song note-by-note. Chen hinted that she must be a professional musician. She explained, “When I was a child, I practiced music regularly.”\n\nChen implored her to perform a song. Lin replied, “I haven’t practiced my music for such a long time, I’ve forgotten the rhythm of most of the songs, and I’m afraid that those who know better will laugh at me.” After he tried again to persuade her, she bowed her head and began then to beat time, singing tunes from Yizhou and Liangzhou in tones that were sad and moving. When the songs were finished, she burst into tears.\n\nChen, touched as well by the sorrow of the music, held her in his arms and comforted her, saying, “Darling, no more songs of fallen kingdoms—they make people unhappy.”\n\n“Tunes like these reflect one’s feelings,” Lin replied, “and someone who is sad cannot sing a joyful song, any more than a happy person can sing a sorrowful one.” And so the two took great pleasure in their relationship, living in extraordinary harmony.\n\nOver time, family members began eavesdropping on them, and when they heard Lin’s singing, they couldn’t restrain their tears. Chen’s wife caught a glimpse of Lin’s beauty, and doubting that any human being could be so hauntingly lovely, she decided that if Lin wasn’t a ghost, she must certainly be a fox; fearing that Chen had taken up with some dreadful monster, she tried to convince him to cut off the relationship.\n\nChen couldn’t stand listening to this, yet he adamantly demanded the truth of Lin. She paled as she answered, “I was once a maid in the palace of Prince Heng. I met with disaster and died, seventeen years ago. Because you are so very honorable, I’ve given myself to you in pleasure, but in all honesty, I couldn’t bear to bring trouble down on you. If you see me now with suspicion or fear, then I should go.”\n\nChen insisted, “I don’t doubt you; but since it’s the case that we’re as close as a married couple, I must know the truth about you.” Then he asked her about things inside the palace. She described her past with full detail and artistry. When her narration came to the decay of Prince Heng’s fortunes, she became choked by sobs and couldn’t continue speaking.\n\nSince Lin didn’t really need to sleep, every night she got up and chanted the sutras for protection, praying to the Buddha with scriptures and recitations. Chen asked her, “Can someone in the underworld still reflect upon personal sins?”\n\n“One may,” she replied. “When I consider how my last life sank into ruin, I hope to do a measure of good to improve my next one.”\n\nShe frequently evaluated poetry and lyrics with Chen, and when there were some defects, she would critique them; as for the best phrases, she gracefully recited them with her lovely voice. Her frame of mind was so literary and unconstrained, Chen would simply forget he was tired. “Do you write poetry?” he asked her.\n\n“When I was alive,” Lin replied, “I did occasionally.” Chen begged her for some of it. Lin smiled and told him, “They were a child’s words, hardly adequate to show a learned person like you.”\n\nLin lived with Chen for three years. One evening, she suddenly appeared, grief-stricken, to bid him farewell. Terribly shaken, Chen asked her to explain. She told him, “The Hell King has decided that since I wasn’t guilty of any crimes in my previous life, and I’ve never neglected since then to read and chant the scriptures, he will allow me to be reborn into the Wang household. I must leave tonight, and we can never hope to see each other again.” She concluded her words in wrenching sorrow. Chen, too, was weeping.\n\nThen Chen set out some wine for them to drink away their pain. Lin began to sing with mournful passion, taking the music of each word in a hundred directions with her grief; each time she came to a particularly sad point in the song, she would break into sobs. She had to stop and begin again several times before she could finish the song, and they took no joy from their drinking.\n\nLin rose then, wavering on the point of leaving. Chen pulled her to him firmly, and they sat together for a few moments more. At the sound of the cock suddenly crowing, Lin told him, “You mustn’t detain me any longer. Yet you have often chided me for not agreeing to show you my homely writing; now that I’m about to part from you forever, I’ll try quickly to write something for you, though the rhythm won’t be very good.”\n\nShe asked for a brush, and once she’d composed the poem, declared, “With a saddened heart and confused mind, I can’t give you a polished piece, and since its cadences may be divided wrongly, please don’t take it out and show it to anyone.” Then she covered her face with her sleeve and departed. Chen accompanied her just outside his gate, where she simply disappeared.\n\nChen, devastated, stood there a good long time. When he looked at Lin’s poem, he noticed that her characters were beautifully shaped, a treasure that he would always cherish. The poem read:\n\nStill and calm, I lay buried near the palace for seventeen years,\n\nAnd wondered—who will think of the vanished empire?\n\nI think upon the vacant palace, its arbors sealed up,\n\nAnd weep, hoping that you, my Prince, have been reborn a cuckoo.\n\nAs the sea’s billowy waves wash over the land at sunset,\n\nThe Han dynasty’s pipes and drums have been silenced, its beacon fires extinguished.\n\nThis weak, beautiful woman cannot become an evil spirit after death,\n\nFor with a pure heart, grieving, I think only of the Buddhist truth.\n\nI’ve chanted the bodhi’s phrases many, many times a day,\n\nAnd when not busy, I’ve read two or three sutras.\n\nI have sung for you the spirited songs of Liyuan instead of weeping;\n\nNow, in your solitude, you may also shed your tears.\n\nIn being repeated many times, this poem may no longer be completely intact, and I suspect it may contain some errors.",

He was already lying on his bed when the moon began shining as bright as white silk, and being unable to fall asleep, he’d had his servant boy give him a massage.\n\nLater, he suddenly heard something on the roof of the boat, like a child walking over a reed mat, starting at the far end of the boat and coming closer, gradually approaching his part of the cabin. Concerned that someone might be trying to rob him, he anxiously got up and asked his servant about it. The boy had also heard it.\n\nWhile Wang was questioning the boy, he saw someone lean over the top of the boat and support himself, so he could lower his head upside down and spy into the cabin. Quite shaken, Wang grabbed his sword and cried out for all of his servants, awakening everyone on board.\n\nWang reported to them what he had seen. Some of them wondered if perhaps he’d made a mistake. All at once, something made the sound again. The group began looking around, but there was no sign of an intruder, only a few stars and the bright moon, along with the endless lapping of the river’s waves.\n\nThe group took their seats in the boat, and before long, they saw a blue fire in the shape of a lantern suddenly emerging from the water and floating; little by little, it drew closer to the boat, till the blue fire suddenly dissipated. At once a dark figure stood up there, towering above the water, and using its hands to cling to the boat, began walking alongside it.\n\nEveryone made a clamor and cried, “Surely this is the thing!” They wanted to shoot it. Just as they were drawing their bows, it hastily dove into the water, and they could no longer see it. They asked the boatman about it.

        "title": "Official Lu’s Daughter",
        "body": "Zhang Yudan of Zhaoyuan possessed an indomitable personality that could not be restrained. He had been studying at a Buddhist monastery. At the time, his town was presided over by an official named Lu, who was from east of the Liao River, and whose daughter loved to hunt. Zhang was taking a walk in the countryside when he came across her, observing her gracefully refined beauty clothed in a luxurious sable robe, lightly riding a small black horse, as if she were in a painting. He returned home, recalling the beauty he’d glimpsed in the valley, remembering her with admiration and fondness.\n\nLater he heard that the girl had died of a sudden illness, and in his mournful sighing for her, he wanted to die. Because he was far away from his family, Lu put his daughter’s coffin in the monastery where Zhang was studying.\n\nZhang performed religious obeisance at the coffin as if the girl was a deity, always burning incense in the mornings and offering food sacrifices to her. Each time, he poured a ceremonial libation of wine on the ground and would say in benediction, “Despite having seen only the profile of your noble face, I’ve grown quite attached to you; I didn’t expect that you would die before I had a chance to get to know you. Now though you’re right in front of me, we’re as far apart as rivers and mountains, which drives me to distraction! Although in real life our behavior would have to be limited and restrained, there’s no need for a dead spirit to be cautious—so if, in the underworld, you understand my feelings for you, please take steps to come see me, which I would find comforting.” For several weeks, he spoke these words day and night.\n\nOne night, having just studied under a lantern for his evening reading, he suddenly raised his head—and there was the girl wearing a smile, standing in the lantern’s light. Startled, Zhang jumped up and asked what had happened. The girl replied, “I could sense your feelings towards me, and I couldn’t help but forget the usual concerns about reputation and run here to meet you.” Zhang was overjoyed, and together they were rapturously in love.\n\nFrom then on, he spent no more empty nights without her. The girl explained to Zhang, “I was born with a passion for hunting and riding, so shooting river deer and slaughtering stags always made me happy, but it was a great sin, and once I died, I wasn’t allowed to find peace. If you truly care about me and love me, please take the trouble of reciting the Diamond Sutra for me 5,048 times, which I shall never forget for generations.”\n\nZhang respectfully took her words to heart; each night he’d get up, come to her coffin, and expressively recite the scriptures while fingering his prayer beads. When it came time for a festival, Zhang wanted to take her home with him. The girl worried that with her tiny, weak feet, she wouldn’t be able to undertake a long journey. Zhang begged her to let him carry her, and with a smile, the girl agreed. It was like carrying an infant, except that she wasn’t heavy, and Zhang never got tired. Thus it became a common occurrence for them.\n\nEven when Zhang was going to take the exams, he’d carry her with him, though he had to travel at night to do so. As Zhang was just about to leave to take the provincial examination, the girl told him, “You have no luck, so it will be a futile effort for you to go there and take the exam.” After listening to her words, he didn’t go after all.\n\nFour or five years passed, and Lu, no longer serving as an official, had become so poor that he couldn’t afford a carriage for his daughter’s coffin to be transported to his hometown and was just about to bury her near the monastery, but ran into trouble getting a place for her grave. Zhang then personally assured him, “I have some ground near the monastery, and I’d like to have her buried there.” This relieved Master Lu considerably.\n\nZhang did everything he could in managing the funeral. Lu was respectfully grateful for Zhang’s deeds, although he couldn’t understand Zhang’s motivation. Once Lu left, Zhang and the girl resumed their usual meetings as before.\n\nOne night, while she was turned towards Zhang and laying upon his chest, the girl’s tears fell like spilled beans as she cried, “Five happy years now come to an end! I’m so indebted to you that several lifetimes won’t be long enough for me to repay you!” Shaken, Zhang asked her what she meant. She explained, “I have received your favor and efforts at helping me as a spirit in the underworld. Now all your chanting has reduced my sins sufficiently for me to be reborn in Hebei to the family of Minister of Revenue Lu. In order not to forget our time together, fifteen years from now, on August 16, please make plans to meet with me again.”\n\nZhang wept as he said, “I’m over thirty years old; in another fifteen years I’ll be too old, so what’s the point of our meeting then?”\n\nThe girl, also crying, replied, “I wish I could repay you, even just by being your servant.” After pausing for a bit, she declared, “You can carry me for six or seven _li_. This route is full of thistles and thorns, and it will be very hard for me due to my long clothes.” Then she threw her arms around Zhang’s neck.\n\nHe accompanied her to the main road, where he saw a cluster of vehicles and horses nearby, with one or two people on each horse; there were three or four people in each carriage, and ten or so other people of various sorts; there was a single carriage decorated with patterns of inlaid gold and a red-tassled, embroidered curtain at the front, attended only by an old lady. She saw the girl arrive and cried, “Are you coming or not?”\n\n“I’m coming,” the girl responded. Then she turned back to Zhang and told him, “This is it, we have to part now; don’t forget what I told you.” Zhang promised. She walked over to the carriage, where the old woman put out her hand to help her up, then the carriage wheels began to turn as the vehicles and horses noisily departed.\n\nDownhearted, Zhang returned home, writing down the date of their rendezvous on the wall. Because he realized that the reciting of the Diamond Sutra had been effective, he offered even more sincere recitations of the scriptures. He dreamt that a holy man announced to him, “Your devotion is to be commended, but you must go to the south sea where the goddess Guanyin assigns activities to priests.”\n\n“How do I get to the south sea?” asked Zhang.\n\nThe holy man replied, “It is as close as your own heart.” Zhang woke up, understood the meaning of his dream, and decided to devote himself to the Buddhist scriptures with a renewed conviction.\n\nThree years went by and his two sons successfully passed the civil service examinations with top rankings. And though Zhang quickly rose in social status and wealth, he didn’t lose his focus on performing benevolent deeds.\n\nOne night he dreamt that someone dressed as a servant requested that he follow, till he saw a person sitting in a palace who looked like the bodhisattva, Guanyin, and who welcomed him by saying, “Your deeds really deserve to be rewarded, so it’s a pity that you weren’t going to have a longer life. Fortunately, I reported this to heaven and you’ll be allowed to live longer.”\n\nZhang prostrated himself and kowtowed. He was told to rise and was given a place to sit, where he was provided tea to drink that smelled as fragrant as orchids. Then a boy was directed to lead him to a pond where he could bathe. The pond water was so perfectly clear that one could count the number of fish swimming in it and he entered its pleasant warmth, smelling its lotus fragrance when he scooped some up into his hands.\n\nAfter a few moments, as he began moving about, he lost his footing, went under, and consequently drowned. He was startled awake from a deep sleep and thought it all rather strange.\n\nHenceforth, his body began growing stronger, as did his eyesight. When he stroked his beard, the white hairs all came out, and after quite a while, the black hairs that took their places fell out as well. The lines in his face also gradually relaxed. After several months had passed, his jaw became as bald as a boy’s face, just like a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old. He often wandered about carefree and made fun of things, also like a boy. He was no longer particular about the way he dressed; his two sons often redressed him.\n\nShortly after this, his wife succumbed to the illness from which she’d long been suffering and died. His sons urged him to search for a new wife among the wealthy families. Zhang replied, “Wait for me to go to Hebei, and once I return, I’ll marry.”\n\nHe calculated the time remaining until the appointed day, then arranged for servants and horses to accompany him to Hebei. He searched for information about Minister of Revenue Lu and found that there was such a person for sure. A daughter had been born to the Lu family who at birth was already able to speak, and who had grown increasingly wise and beautiful, so her parents loved her very deeply.\n\nThough wealthy families inquired about marriage arrangements, the girl always refused them. Surprised, her parents asked her why and she frankly told them she was waiting for Zhang to appear for an appointment that had been set up in her previous incarnation. When they totaled up his age, her parents roared with laughter and said, “How silly of you! Master Zhang is already fifty and naturally will have changed greatly, his very bones having become decrepit; even if he’s still alive, he’ll be balding and toothless.” The girl wouldn’t listen to them.\n\nHer mother could see she was determined not to budge, so she conferred with Master Lu and warned the gatekeeper not to allow any visitors to enter, and once the date of the appointment had passed, her daughter would give up because of her disappointment in Zhang. Soon afterwards, Zhang arrived and the gatekeeper refused to admit him.\n\nHe left and returned to his inn, disappointed that there was nothing he could do about it. He loitered at the outskirts of town, making private inquiries while wandering about.\n\nWhen the girl was told that Zhang had failed to keep his appointment, she cried and refused to eat. Her mother said, “The gentleman hasn’t come, so he must have passed away; and even if that’s not the case, he’s guilty of breaking his promise and hence you have nothing to be blamed for.” The girl said nothing, but spent all day in bed.\n\nLu was worried about her, and thought about taking a look at Zhang, so he pretended to take a stroll outside town till he came across Zhang. When he saw that Zhang was a young man, he was amazed. Drawing him out with a bit of conversation, he found Zhang very open and easy-going. Lu was delighted, so he invited Zhang to come home with him.\n\nJust as Zhang was about to ask Lu about himself, the official hastily walked up to his door, begging his guest to have a seat by himself for a few moments, then hurried inside to tell his daughter. The girl, overjoyed, managed to get up out of bed by herself. She peeked out to check on him, but found that his appearance didn’t fit with his age, began to cry, and returned, complaining that her father had deceived her. Lu swore that it was Zhang. The girl said nothing and wouldn’t stop weeping.\n\nLu went back outside, feeling dejected, and informed his guest that the situation had changed and he could no longer invite him to stay. “Is this how the noble Minister of Revenue keeps his promises?” asked Zhang.\n\nLu answered him casually. Then he turned his head away and looked around, serving to show that Zhang was no longer his guest. Zhang understood Lu’s meaning, took his leave and departed.\n\nThe girl wept pitifully for several days and then died. That night, Zhang dreamt that the girl came to him and said, “Was the man I saw that day really you? Your age and looks are strangely at odds, but if we’d seen each other, we’d have been inseparable. I was so distraught afterwards that I died. I must trouble you to go to our local ancestral temple to call my spirit back; if you can, you must save me now because if you delay, it’ll be too late.”\n\nHe awakened immediately and rushed to the Lu family’s gate, learning that their daughter had been dead for two days. Grief-stricken, Zhang proceeded to the room set up as a memorial for her. Then he described what he had dreamt to Lu.\n\nLu followed his instructions, calling her spirit to come back from the temple and return home. He undid her burial clothes and began to massage her corpse, reciting blessings for her.\n\nInstantly he heard the sound of coughing come from her throat. Then he suddenly saw her mouth open and out came lumps of phlegm that were as cold as ice. He removed her to a bed and gradually she resumed breathing and could utter a few words.\n\nMaster Lu was euphoric and solicitously led Zhang outside, where he put on a feast for him. As he pursued a detailed inquiry into Zhang’s rank and background and learned that he was from an esteemed family, he grew even happier. Then they picked an auspicious day for the marriage ceremony.\n\nZhang stayed there for half a month, then took his bride home. Lu accompanied them to their house, stayed with them for six months, and then left. Husband and wife lived together like young newlyweds, and people who didn’t know them often mistook their sons and daughters-in-law for their parents-in-law.\n\nMaster Lu died the next year. At that time, Lu’s son, too young to defend himself, was ruined by a local despot, who reduced his family possessions to nothing. Zhang welcomed him into his own home and treated him as one of his own family members.",

        "title": "The Daoist Priest",
        "body": "Scholar Han, who came from an affluent and influential family, loved to invite visitors to his home. In his village, there was a man named Xu, who often came to drink at his place. Once, when they were having a dinner party together, a Daoist priest came to his gate, begging for alms. Han’s servant tossed him some money and corn, but he wouldn’t accept it; nor would he go away. The servant became angry and went back inside without turning back to look at him.\n\nHan heard a pounding at the door for some time, then asked who it was, and his servant described the situation. But before he’d finished explaining, the Daoist had actually entered, so Han invited him to have a seat. The Daoist just raised his hands to the host and guests casually, then sat down at once. Han briefly asked him about himself, and hence found out that the priest was living east of the village in an abandoned temple. “I wasn’t informed that you had settled into that temple,” said Han, “I’ve been quite remiss in a host’s courtesy.”\n\nThe Daoist replied, “I’m a rough country fellow just recently arrived. I haven’t made friends here. I heard that you were a generous scholar, and I would greatly like to ask you for a drink.” Han ordered a cup to be brought for him. The Daoist proved able to drink a prodigious amount. Xu looked at the priest’s dirty, ragged clothes, became quite disdainful, and wasn’t very courteous to him. Han also treated him as a common traveler. The Daoist drained more than twenty cups of wine, then took his leave and went on his way.\n\nFrom then on, any time Han gave a dinner party, the Daoist was sure to show up, eating when he saw food and drinking when he found wine, while Han, meanwhile, became rather vexed with his frequent presence. One time when they were drinking, Xu mocked the priest by saying, “You’re always ready to be the guest, so why don’t you ever serve as the host once in awhile?”\n\nThe priest grinned and replied, “I’m just like you—a pair of shoulders holding up a mouth.” Xu, ashamed, found himself unable to reply. The Daoist remarked, “Nevertheless, I’ve been sincerely thinking about my gratitude to you for a long time, so I’ll do my utmost to make it up to you with cups of my poor wine.” He drank his fill, then declared, “At noon tomorrow, I hope you’ll favor me with your company.”\n\nThe next day, Han and Xu met and went to the temple together, doubtful that the Daoist would be able to entertain them. While they were on their way, the Daoist had stopped to wait for them; then they all chatted as they walked until they reached the temple gate. As they entered it, the courtyard appeared completely renovated, with tall, elegant pavilions now attached. Amazed, Han said, “It’s been a long time since we came here—when was the construction done?”\n\nThe priest replied, “The work was completed not long ago.” He gestured for them to enter his room, where the furnishings were more magnificent than even an aristocratic family could afford. The two men were immediately awestruck. As soon as they were seated, they were brought wine and food by handsome sixteen-yearold boys wearing brocade clothing and red shoes. The wine and food were aromatic and delicious, abundantly and extravagantly prepared.\n\nWhen the meal was over, additional desserts were brought in. There were many fruit delicacies that they couldn’t even name, all displayed in crystal or jade vessels that lit up the table and seats. The wine was poured into glass cups with rims almost a _chi_ in circumference. The Daoist said, “Call for the Shi sisters to come.”\n\nA boy left and a moment later, two beauties walked in. One was tall and slender as a young willow, the other short and considerably younger; the pair were incomparably lovely. The Daoist then directed them to sing, to encourage his guests to drink more. The younger girl beat the rhythm and sang while the older one played the xiao, their sounds pristine and delicate. Each time they finished a song, the priest would solicitously urge the others to drain their cups, then he’d order the girls to fill them again. He turned around and asked the beauties, “It’s been a long time since you danced, so can you still do it?”\n\nThen the servants rolled out a carpet beneath the hall’s roof and the two girls danced, their long garments whipping about briskly while their fragrant scent filled the room; when they were finished dancing, they rested against a painted screen. The two men were enraptured and unwittingly became drunk.\n\nThe Daoist raised his cup and drained it, then without looking at his guests, stood up and declared, “For now, I’ll trouble you to help yourselves to the wine—I’ll take a little rest and come right back.” Then he walked away.\n\nNext to the wall on the south side of the room was a bed with mother-of-pearl inlay, upon which the girls laid a brocade mattress before helping the priest to lay down. The Daoist then pulled the older girl onto the bed to sleep with him and ordered the younger girl to stand by the bed in case he needed to have an itch scratched.\n\nHan and Xu saw all this and became indignant. Xu then cried, “A priest can’t do that kind of rude stuff!” He ran over to stop the Daoist. The priest quickly jumped up and fled. When Xu saw the younger girl standing by the bed, he used the excuse of his drunkenness to drag her over to a bed on the opposite side of the room, brazenly embracing her as he lay down.\n\nXu glanced over at the older girl, still reclining on the brocade mattress. He turned to Han and exclaimed, “Why’re you being so restrained?”\n\nHan then went straight over and climbed onto the bed; he wanted to make love to the girl, but she was already asleep and though he nudged her, she didn’t respond. Hence he put his arms around her and went to sleep.\n\nAt dawn, he awoke sober and felt his chest touching something icy cold; he looked and saw that he was hugging a long stone at the bottom of some dark steps. He quickly searched for Xu, who was still asleep; he found Xu resting his head on a stone ordinarily reserved for stepping on while relieving oneself, sleeping it off in a foul latrine.\n\nHan kicked him till he got up and both were astonished. They looked around, discovering the courtyard overgrown with weeds, two run-down huts—and that was all.",

        "title": "The Hu Clan",
        "body": "In Zhili, a prominent family was looking to hire a teacher. A _xiucai_ suddenly showed up at their gate and recommended himself. The master of the house invited him in. The scholar’s words were open-minded and frank, so he and his host got along quite well together. Once the _xiucai_ had identified his family name as Hu, the master advanced him his fee and arranged for him to live with them.\n\nHu was very diligent in his teaching and grading, and was far more learned than other scholars. Yet at times he would venture out and return home late at night; though the doors were bolted shut and no one heard him knock for them to open the door, he was always able to get back into his room. Consequently they knew that he was a fox. But when they watched him carefully, they confirmed that he wasn’t evil and treated him generously once again as an outstanding individual, maintaining their manner despite his strange identity.\n\nHu knew that his host had a daughter, so he let on that he’d love to marry her, and though he repeatedly indicated his interest, his host pretended not to notice. One day, Hu took a brief leave from his work and left.\n\nThe next day, a visitor arrived and tied up his black donkey at the gate. The master welcomed him, and then they went inside. The guest was over fifty, his clothing and shoes fresh and clean, his manner calm and refined. Once they were seated, the visitor explained that his reason for coming was to deliver Hu’s proposal of marriage.\n\nThe host was silent, then after a very long time, said, “Mr. Hu and I are already friends, so what’s the need of marrying into the family? At any rate, my daughter’s already engaged to someone. Please express my regrets to Mr. Hu.”\n\nThe visitor replied, “We know for a fact that your daughter is available, so why reject the proposal this way?” Over and over again he persisted, but the host was resolute. With an embarrassed look, the visitor exclaimed, “Mr. Hu is also from a prominent family, so why do you worry that he’s not qualified to become your son-in-law?”\n\nThe host told him straight out, “To be honest, that’s not the problem—my only fear is that he’s not of the same species that we are.” The visitor heard this and grew angry; the host also became infuriated, and their disagreement escalated with increasing hostility.\n\nThe visitor stood up and seized the host. The host then ordered his servants to take sticks and chase him away, so the visitor ran off.\n\nHe left behind his donkey, so they examined it, finding it to be a large creature with black hair, pointed ears, and long tail. They tugged at it but it wouldn’t budge, and when they tried to force it to move, it immediately fell down, chirping, and became a grasshopper.\n\nBecause of his visitor’s angry words, the host knew that they would certainly seek revenge on his family, so he warned everyone to be ready for anything. As a result, fox soldiers arrived the next day, some as cavalry and some on foot, some bearing spears, some crossbows, the horses neighing and the soldiers roaring, an intimidating exhibition of power. The host didn’t dare venture out. The foxes cried out for his house to be burned, and the host became even more frightened.\n\nOne particularly vigorous family servant commanded his fellows to make a raucous charge against the foxes, lobbing stones and firing arrows, with both sides taking damage and suffering losses. The foxes were gradually fended off and retreated one after the other. They left their swords behind on the ground, shining like frost on snow; but when the servants drew near and picked them up, they became sorghum leaves. They laughed and said, “This is all their tricks can do.” Even so, they were afraid that the foxes might come back, so they accelerated their preparations just in case.\n\nThe next day, as the servants gathered to discuss things, a giant suddenly dropped out of the sky: it was more than a _zhang_ tall, its body several _chi_ wide; it waved a sword as big as a door while it chased and struck down people. The servants launched volleys of arrows and stones that struck it till it fell, stiff and dead, and they discovered it to be just a paper figure like those used in funerals. Thus the servants became more relaxed towards the foxes.\n\nThe foxes didn’t return for three days, so the servants let down their guard. The host was just walking to an outhouse, when all of a sudden the fox soldiers appeared, firing arrows wildly as they came; one of them hit him in the buttocks. Terribly frightened, he anxiously cried for his servants, and as they rushed out to fight, the foxes ran away. When they plucked the arrow out of the host, they found that it was just a wormwood stalk. It was like this for more than a month, with the foxes making sporadic sallies, and though the foxes couldn’t cause serious injuries, the host’s family still had to remain on guard every day, which distressed the host.\n\nOne day, Hu was leading his army against the house. When the host rushed outside, he spotted Hu. The host called for him so insistently that Hu had no choice but to answer him, stepping out from the crowd. “Upon reflection, I believe I’ve never treated you illmanneredly,” declared the host, “so why have you mobilized these soldiers against me?” The troop of foxes wanted to shoot their arrows at him, but Hu prevented them.\n\nThe host approached and took Hu by the hand, urging him to enter his house, and had wine set out so they could enjoy themselves. Calmly the host said, “You’re a wise individual, so I hope we can forgive each other. Thinking over our warm friendship, how could I not be overjoyed to have you marry into my family? But your carriages and horses, your homes, they’re not at all like those used by people, so if my daughter lived together with you, you must know it simply could never go well. As the proverb says, ‘There are melons and fruits that can be picked, but people cannot eat them unless they’re cooked.’ Why persist in your choice?” Hu was quite ashamed. “It doesn’t matter,” the host said, “our old friendship is intact. If you haven’t completely rejected us human beings, I’d like to suggest that your pupil, my fifteen-year-old son, be married into your family as your brother-in-law. Don’t you have some proper match for him in your family?”\n\nHu joyfully replied, “I have a little sister who’s a year younger than your son, and really quite attractive. What about offering her as his wife?”\n\nThe host stood to bow respectfully, and Hu replied with his own bow. Thereupon they toasted each other quite merrily, their former strife entirely forgotten. The host ordered more wine brought out, feasted the fox with food, and absolutely everyone was satisfied.\n\nThen the host inquired in detail about Hu’s hometown since he wanted to send his family a gift for setting up the marriage agreement. Hu declined it, however. The lights burned late into the evening until, quite drunk, the fox took his leave. The result of all of this was peace.\n\nMore than a year passed, but Hu didn’t show up. Some people suspected that he’d forgotten the marriage agreement, but the host waited faithfully for him. Six months more went by, then Hu suddenly arrived. He exchanged greetings with the host, then said, “My little sister has grown up. Please select an auspicious date for the wedding so we can send for her here and serve you and your wife as our parents-in-law.”\n\nThe host was very pleased, so they promptly set a date together, and then Hu departed. When night arrived, a horse and carriage appeared as had been agreed, delivering the bride. She had a sumptuous trousseau which utterly filled the room in which it was placed. When the bride was spotted by her husband’s parents, they thought her extraordinarily gentle and beautiful. The host was overjoyed.\n\nHu and his younger brother came together to accompany the bride, both gentlemen proving to be skilled conversationalists and enthusiastic drinkers. When the next day came, the Hu’s left. The bride was able to foretell when the year’s crops would be abundant or would fail, so the family’s decisions about their livelihood all depended upon the bride’s judgments. Hu, his younger brother, and their old mother sometimes came to visit the girl, and everyone saw them appear at those times.",

But if he was offered food and drink, money, or treats, he wouldn’t accept them; when he was asked what he needed, he wouldn’t answer. All day long, he was never seen eating a meal.\n\nSomeone asked him, “Since you’re not eating meat or drinking alcohol, and you’d be better off collecting donations in the mountain areas or in small streets and alleys, why do you come to this stinking, noisy place every day?” The monk closed his eyes and began to chant, his eyelashes a finger’s width in length, as if he hadn’t heard.\n\nA moment later, he was asked the question again. The monk immediately opened his eyes wide and in a stern voice cried, “I want to collect in this way!” He continued chanting without a pause. After a long while, he just walked away.\n\nWhen some of the people followed after him, insistently soliciting the reason that he was acting like this, he walked on without answering. They asked him repeatedly till he said once again in a stern voice, “You just don’t get it! I need to collect in this way!”\n\nAfter a number of days, suddenly he went out the south gate of the city and laid down beside the road like a dead man, without moving for three days. The townspeople were afraid that he was starving to death and that they’d be involved in some kind of trouble because of it. Then they tried to persuade him to leave by offering him meals if he wanted to eat or money if he’d ask for some. The monk, however, closed his eyes and didn’t move. The crowd shook him and kept talking to him.\n\nThe monk became angry, drew a short sword from his patched robe, and sliced open his belly; with his hand, he reached inside himself, pulled his intestines out on the road, and consequently died. The horrified crowd informed the local prefecture and they buried him rolled up inside a grass mat.\n\nSometime later, dogs dug up the grave, revealing the grass mat. Someone stepped on it and found it empty inside. When they dug the whole mat out of the grave and examined it, they found it contained nothing inside, like an empty cocoon."

Outside a gate, a doctor who was ringing a bell to draw attention declared that he could help vanquish the fox. The academician then invited him to enter the gate. The medicine the doctor gave him was an aphrodisiac. The doctor urged the academician to take the medicine, go back to his room, and then have sex with the fox, reasoning that his health would then be so vigorous that the fox wouldn’t be able to handle it.\n\nIndeed, the fox recoiled, demanding that he leave it alone; but the academician ignored it and approached the fox with increasing boldness.

A huge stone was situated in the river, so the girl was crouched upon it. There were strands of lovely green, slick algae, floating and rippling, that wound around the rock three times. The girl stared at it and felt moved by it in her heart.\n\nAs soon as she returned home, she discovered she was pregnant, and her belly gradually began swelling up. Her mother privately questioned her, and Su told her about the algae. Her mother couldn’t make sense of it.\n\nSeveral months later, she gave birth to a son. Su wished she could just abandon him, but she couldn’t bear the thought of it, so she hid him in a small chest and raised him herself. Then she swore that she’d never marry, in order to focus only on him. However, to be pregnant without a husband was a shameful matter. So by the time the boy was seven, he’d never gone out or seen another person.\n\nSuddenly one day the boy said to his mother, “I’ve gradually grown up, so how much longer can you keep me confined here? I should leave, to stop burdening you.” Su asked him where he would go. He replied, “I’m not a human being, so I’m going to fly through the clouds to the highest valley.”\n\nSu wept and asked him when he would come back home. “You must wait until your time to die,” he told her, “for only then will I come back. After I’m gone, if you need anything, you can open the chest where you hid me and look inside it, where you’ll find whatever it is you need.” Once he’d finished speaking, he paid his respects to his mother and left. She ran out to look for him, but he’d already disappeared. Su informed her mother, who thought it all very strange.\n\nSu kept her old oath and stayed with her mother, but the family became increasingly impoverished. When it even happened that there was nothing left for breakfast, they looked around their house and simply couldn’t figure out what to do. Suddenly she recalled her son’s words, so she went to open the chest and found rice in it, which she used for their meal. From that point forward, whenever she needed something, she always found it in the chest.\n\nWhen three years passed, her mother fell ill and died; everything that she needed for the burial ceremony, she found when she opened the chest. After the funeral, Su lived alone for thirty years, never even going outside her door.\n\nOne day, a neighbor woman who came to borrow some coals for her fire spotted Su sitting stiffly, all alone, and spoke to her briefly, then left. Before long, from her home the neighbor saw colorful clouds begin circling Su’s house, slender and straight as a large umbrella, and inside them stood a splendidly attired person, whom, upon careful examination, the woman recognized as Su. She hovered there for a long time, then gradually rose higher and higher until she could no longer be seen.\n\nThe neighbors were all amazed at this. They went to Su’s house to look for themselves and found her gorgeously dressed, just sitting there, already dead. Rather than returning home, the neighbors discussed how she should be buried since she had never married.\n\nSuddenly a young man entered, handsome and refined, greeting the group and expressing his thanks to them. The neighbors knew by rumor that Su had a son, so his presence didn’t surprise them. The young man took out some money to pay for his mother’s burial, and planted two peach trees at her grave before he took his leave. When he was just a few steps away, clouds formed beneath his feet, and after that they could no longer see him.\n\nSince then, the peach trees have produced sweet and fragrant fruit that the locals call “Su the Immortal’s Peaches,” and year after year, the trees flourish, producing abundant yields and have never become decrepit. Officials there often take the peach fruits from the trees as gifts to friends and relatives.",

        "body": "Scholar Li Boyan lived in Yishui. He was a man of uncompromising integrity and heroic spirit. When he experienced a sudden attack of serious illness, his family members tried to get him to take some medicine but he refused it, saying, “My sickness can’t be cured by medicine. The underworld is missing its Hell King, so they want me to serve in his place temporarily. When I die, don’t bury me—just wait.” That very day, he died.\n\nA servant conducted him on his way until they entered a palace and Li received his official garments; subordinates and clerks respectfully waited in attendance on him quite solemnly. The account books were piled up together on a table. Consultation of one set of records revealed that south of the Yangzi, there was a man who had reportedly raped eighty-two women of respectable families. Further investigation verified the allegations to be true. According to the laws of the underworld, the man was to be tortured by a burning bronze pillar.\n\nBelow the hall of investigation, there was a bronze pillar eight or nine _chi_ tall that one could reach one’s arms around; its hollow center was now filled with blazing coals, so that inside and out it was red hot. A group of attendant ghosts bludgeoned the man with spiked iron caltrops, driving him to climb up the pillar to evade them by scrambling with his hands and feet until he made it to the top.\n\nOnce there, the smoke from his flesh burning billowed up and away, his body popping with a sound like firecrackers, and then he fell down; he lay crumpled there for some time before he regained consciousness. The ghosts forced him up the pillar again till, burning and popping, he fell down as before. On his third impact, he spread over the ground like smoke, no longer able to maintain his form.\n\nAnother case came up in which Wang, from Li’s hometown, had been accused by the father of a maidservant of kidnapping his daughter. This Wang was one of Li’s relatives by marriage. Originally, a man had offered him the girl for sale. Wang knew it was an illegal transaction but since the seller was asking very little for her, he purchased her. It then happened that Wang died of a sudden illness.\n\nThe following day, his friend Zhou encountered him out on the road, knowing that this was Wang’s ghost, so he ran away from him and fled into his study. Wang followed him inside. Zhou, terrified, wished him well and asked him what he wanted. Wang explained, “I need to trouble you to go the underworld and offer proof of my innocence.”\n\n“What’s the problem?” Zhou asked.\n\n“I honestly paid to purchase my serving girl,” Wang replied, “but now I’ve been accused of kidnapping her. You witnessed the transaction, and I need someone to testify that I’ve been falsely accused, so only your words can do it.” Zhou firmly refused to do so. As Wang left, he said, “I’m afraid you have no choice.”\n\nSoon afterwards, Zhou died, and they were both conducted to the Hell King for investigation. When Li spotted Wang, he privately determined he would take his relative’s side. Suddenly he noticed that the palace had caught fire, and the flames were consuming the building’s beams. Li, stunned, stood aside.\n\nAn official ran up to him and explained, “The underworld doesn’t operate like the human world, since one cannot keep secrets here. You must quickly reject such thoughts in order to extinguish the fire.” As Li quietly concentrated and allayed his concerns, the flames suddenly went out.\n\nWhen they resumed the inquiry, both Wang and the girl’s father repeatedly insisted that they were the injured parties. Li asked Zhou to testify, and Zhou revealed the truth of the matter. Since Wang committed the crime at the time of realizing that he was doing wrong, he was sentenced to be flogged. Once the punishment was administered, Li sent the parties involved back to the world of the living. Zhou and Wang each returned to life after three days.\n\nOnce Li had seen this business concluded, he took a horse and carriage and returned home. Partway there he observed several hundred wrongdoers whose heads or feet were missing, prostrating themselves and wailing their sorrows. He stopped his carriage to investigate what had happened and discovered that they had all been away from home when they died and wanted to return to their native soil, but because they were afraid of being prevented from crossing the border, they begged Li for a travel permit. Li said, “I served in my appointment for three days, but now my appointment’s concluded, so what can I do to assist you?”\n\nThe mob replied, “In a village to the south lives a man named Hu who’s just about to conduct a Buddhist ceremony, and if you’ll advise him of our problem, he’ll be able to help us.” Li promised he would do so. Upon arriving at his home, his underworld servants all left, and Li then returned to life from the dead.\n\nHu Shuixin, a friend of his, heard that Li had come back to life and decided to pay him a visit. Li hastily asked him, “When are you holding the Buddhist ceremony?”\n\nHu, amazed at this, replied, “Now that the turmoil of war is past, my wife and children having survived it, I expressed to my wife my wish to make offerings to the Buddha, but we haven’t mentioned it to anyone. How’d you know about it?” Li then told him all about it. Hu exclaimed in amazement, “Words spoken in the bedroom can be spread to the underworld—it’s terrible!” Then he respectfully promised he would help the people.\n\nThe next day, Li traveled to Wang’s home, but Wang was still laying in bed, fatigued. When he saw Li, he immediately stood up and respectfully showed his gratitude, expressing thanks for Li’s help and protection. Li replied, “The law isn’t something one can just ignore magnanimously. Are you suffering less now?”\n\n“It’s no longer so painful,” Wang said to him, “but the wounds from my whipping are still oozing pus.” After more than twenty days, Wang began to heal; the flesh on his buttocks rotted and fell off, leaving behind scars that looked like he’d been caned.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The underworld’s sentences seem inhuman compared to the ones in the world of the living; but the responsibilities there are also more severe than in the living world. Even though there is no clemency in the underworld, the people who suffer from the punishments there have no reason to complain. Who says there’s no justice in the grave? I just regret that there’s no fire to burn the living world’s government offices, where people are unfairly treated!”",

        "title": "Huang the Ninth",
        "body": "He Shican, whose courtesy name was Zixiao, had a study on the east bank of the Tiaoxi, with his gate overlooking an expanse of wilderness. At dusk, when he occasionally went out to take a walk, he spotted a woman riding a donkey, with a young man following along after her. The woman was about fifty and gave the impression of being someone elegant and extraordinary.\n\nHe turned to look at the young man, who was fifteen or sixteen and whose appearance was far more beautiful than even a lovely woman. He Zixiao tended to be attracted to men, so when he saw the young man he became utterly infatuated; he followed them with his eyes as they passed, and it wasn’t until he could no longer see them that he went home.\n\nEarly the next day, he went to wait for them. It wasn’t until sunset that the young man finally came by. Wanting to ingratiate himself, He smiled and asked the young man where he’d come from. “From my grandparents’ home,” he replied. He invited the young man to come to his study for a little rest, but he declined, claiming he was too busy; when He kept insisting, the young man went in with him. He stayed for only a very short time before he eagerly took his leave, and He was unable to dissuade him.\n\nArm-in-arm with the young man, he saw him off and on the way enthusiastically urged him to drop by whenever he was passing through. The young man said he would do so and departed. From then on, He couldn’t stop thinking about him and stared off into the distance, continually pacing back and forth.\n\nOne day, as the sun was setting, the young man suddenly showed up. Overjoyed, He invited him to come in, ordering a servant to bring them food and wine. He asked his guest’s surname and was told, “My name is Huang, the ninth child in my family. I wasn’t given a courtesy name since I wasn’t old enough for one.”\n\n“Why do you keep coming by here?” asked He.\n\nHuang explained, “My mother lives with my grandparents and frequently suffers from illnesses, so I often visit her.” Once they’d had several rounds of wine, Huang wanted to leave. But He wouldn’t hear of it and forced him to stay, closing the door and locking it.\n\nUnable to do anything about it, Huang blushed and sat down. He Zixiao hung up a lantern and as they continued chatting, Huang seemed as shy as a virgin girl; when He said naughty, flirtatious things to him, Huang became so embarrassed that he shyly turned his face to the wall.\n\nBefore long, He was trying to get him under his quilt. Huang wouldn’t let him, firmly claiming that he slept uneasily and hence would disturb He. He Zixiao urged him again and again, so finally Huang took off some of his clothes but kept his pants on as he lay down on the bed. He extinguished the lantern; a moment later, he shifted over onto Huang’s pillow, put his arm over him and his thigh upon Huang’s, intimately embracing the young man and begging him tearfully to make love with him.\n\nHuang furiously exclaimed, “I thought you were supposed to be a refined scholar, that’s why I didn’t leave; then you act like this, trying to force love like a beast!” Soon it grew light from the morning stars in the sky, and Huang went on his way. Fearing that he had left for good and wouldn’t return, He paced frantically, lost in his thoughts.\n\nOnce several days passed, Huang finally did come back. Overjoyed, He apologized for what had happened and vigorously insisted that Huang join him in the study so they could sit together and have an enjoyable conversation, secretly feeling lucky that the young man wasn’t holding his former misconduct against him.\n\nSoon they took off their sandals and climbed onto the bed, with He again caressing Huang lovingly. Huang said, “It’s already clear that you have tender feelings for me, so why do you keep trying to do something more intimate?” With persistent sweet talk, He pleaded with Huang just to let him have a touch of his flesh. Huang allowed him to do so.\n\nWaiting until Huang fell asleep, He then stealthily crept closer and lightly stroked him again. Huang woke up, pulled on his clothes and hastily got up, slipping away despite the fact that it was still dark. Depressed, He acted like he’d suffered a great loss, forgetting to eat and refusing to sleep, gradually becoming exhausted and emaciated. Every day he sent a servant outside his study to keep watch for Huang.\n\nOne day, Huang passed by He’s gate without any intention of stopping. The servant there, however, pulled him inside by clinging to his clothing. Seeing He so thin, Huang was astonished and conveyed his sympathies. He honestly confessed the reasons for his condition to the young man, his falling tears accompanying his explanation. Huang spoke softly as he said, “What you ask is a trifling thing, but the truth is that while our loving each other wouldn’t be of much benefit to me, it would actually be harmful to you and hence I decided not to engage in it. But since that’s what will make you happy, what’s the point of my careful concern?”\n\nThis made He very happy indeed. When Huang left afterwards, He’s illness suddenly subsided and in several days he was fully recovered. Consequently, when Huang next appeared, the two made love together. “Today,” Huang said afterwards, “I did this just for your sake, so I hope we won’t do this often.” Then he added, “I have something to ask of you—would you be willing to help me out with it?”\n\nHe Zixiao asked him what it was, and Huang replied, “My mother is suffering pains to her heart, and only Doctor Qi’s potent heavenly pills can cure her. You have a good relationship with him, so you can get them from him for sure.” He promised he would do so. As he was about to leave, Huang made his plea once again.\n\nHe went into the city to get the medicine and delivered it to Huang that evening. Huang, delighted, thanked him respectfully with his hands clasped together. Again He expressed the urge to make love to him. Huang declared, “Let’s not be hasty. My intention is to obtain a rare beauty for you who’s a far, far better lover than I am.” He Zixiao asked him who she was. Huang explained, “I have a young cousin who’s lovely and cultured. If you’ll go along with this, I’ll act as go-between to repay you.” He gave him a small smile, but didn’t respond. Huang expressed appreciation for the medicine and then left.\n\nThree days later Huang appeared, having returned to request more medicine. Resentful that Huang hadn’t come back earlier, He said many reproachful things to him. Huang replied, “This can only lead to disaster for you, which is why I’ve been distant; but since you don’t understand the purpose behind my behavior, I hope you won’t regret your choice later.” From then on, a night didn’t go by without Huang returning to sleep with He.\n\nEvery three days, He would beg Doctor Qi for more medicine. The doctor complained about the frequency of his requests, saying, “This medicine never fails when it’s taken for three days, so why hasn’t your friend been cured after taking it so long?” Then he wrapped up another three-day dose and gave it to He. The doctor turned around to scrutinize him and declared, “You look run down—are you ill?”\n\n“Not at all,” He replied.\n\nThe doctor checked his pulse and cried in shock, “You have a ghost’s pulse—you’re very sick in the heart and kidneys, and if you’re not careful, your life will be in danger!” He Zixiao went home and told Huang everything.\n\nHuang sighed and exclaimed, “What a fine doctor! I’m really a fox, and I fear that any further contact with me will do you no good.” He Zixiao suspected that Huang was just making up an excuse, so he hid some medicine rather than giving it all to him, thinking that otherwise he might not return.\n\nBefore long, He became ill. Doctor Qi arrived to examine him and said, “Previously, you weren’t honest with me, so now you’re on the verge of dying and even Qin Huan couldn’t help you.” Huang came daily to look after He, saying, “You didn’t listen to me, so this is what you’ve come to!” He Zixiao soon died. Huang wept piteously for him and then went away.\n\nBefore any of this began, there was a certain court official who had been He’s classmate; when he was a young man seventeen years old, he passed the imperial examination and became a member of the Hanlin Academy. At that time, the vice-governor of Shaanxi Province was greedy and ruled cruelly, and since he regularly bribed individuals who served in the palace, no one dared say a word against his behavior. The court official sent a memorial to the emperor exposing the vice-governor’s wicked misdeeds, but he was seen as exceeding his authority and was stripped of his position.\n\nWhen the vice-governor was promoted to provincial governor, he waited daily for an opportunity to revenge himself on the court official. As a young man, the official’s reputation as an outstanding individual earned him a rebel prince’s favor, so upon obtaining some old letters that had passed between the official and the prince, the governor intended to use them against him. Mortified, the official hanged himself. His wife also died by hanging herself.\n\nBut the next morning, the official suddenly regained consciousness and declared, “I’m He Zixiao.” When he was questioned, everything he said referred to He’s family matters, so they realized that He had borrowed the official’s body to return to life. They asked him to stay, but he declined and left to live in He’s former home.\n\nSuspicious that this was all just part of some scheme against him and wanting to remove any dangers, the governor sent men to extort quantities of gold from the official. He pretended to go along with this, though he was almost at the point of despair.\n\nSuddenly Huang arrived to see him, and their feelings toward each other were a mixture of bitterness and happiness. In a short while, He wanted to make love with him again.\n\n“Do you have three lives to spare?” demanded Huang.\n\nHe replied, “I regret having to return to life, which has been very hard on me, rather than remaining dead, which was easier to deal with.” Then he explained to Huang what was bothering him.\n\nHuang gave it some serious thought. After a little while, he replied, “It’s fortunate that you’re alive for us to meet again. You’re an unmarried man and I told you before that my younger cousin, intelligent, beautiful, and resourceful, could surely assist you with your cares and burdens.” He Zixiao wanted to take a look at her. “No problem,” said Huang. “Tomorrow I’ll have her accompany me to visit my mother and then we’ll come past your place. While you pretend to be a brother to me, I’ll fake that I’m thirsty and request something to drink. If you say, ‘The donkey’s run off,’ it’ll mean you consent to the marriage.” Once the plan was concluded, Huang left.\n\nAt noon the next day as planned, Huang was followed by a young woman as they passed outside He’s gate. He greeted Huang humbly with folded hands and engaged him in casual conversation. Stealing a glance at the young woman, He found her beauty delicate and lustrous, truly a most striking woman. Huang requested some tea, so He invited them in for refreshment. “Don’t worry, third sister,” said Huang, “this is my sworn brother, so there’s no harm if we take a short rest here.” Helping her dismount, Huang tied her donkey to He’s gate and they went inside.\n\nHe Zixiao got up to make tea. Continuing to look at the young woman, he told Huang, “Your earlier remarks didn’t do her justice. Why, she’s pretty enough to die for!”\n\nThe girl was aware that He was saying something about his interest in her, so she stood up and in her birdlike voice called out, “Time to leave!”\n\nTurning around to look outside, He cried, “The donkey’s run off!” Huang speedily ran outside. He Zixiao put his arms around the girl and held her close.\n\nThe girl, her face reddening, felt as embarrassed as someone being arrested and shouted loudly for Huang, but there was no answer. She said to He, “You have a wife, so why treat me so shamefully?” He explained he didn’t have a wife. She replied, “If you can swear by the mountains and rivers that you’ll never desert or divorce me, I will always do as you tell me.” Then He sincerely swore such an oath. The girl didn’t resist him any further.\n\nOnce they’d finished their lovemaking, Huang returned. The girl became angry at him. Huang said, “This is He Zixiao, who used to be a well-known scholar and is now a court official. He’s my closest friend and a person upon whom you can always rely. Even when your mother learns all about it, she’ll accept it as no fault of yours.”\n\nDusk approached, but He insisted that they stay and wouldn’t hear of them leaving. The girl was afraid that Huang’s aunt, her mother, would be quite upset. Huang quickly took charge of settling the matter, mounted the donkey, and rode off by himself.\n\nAfter several days, a woman in her forties passed by with her maid, her features just as perfect as the girl’s. He called for the girl to come out and see the woman, who turned out to be her mother. When she saw the girl, she asked in surprise, “What are you doing here?” The girl was so abashed that she couldn’t reply.\n\nHe invited them in, paid his respects to the mother and told her everything. The mother laughed and said, “How childish of Huang—why didn’t he talk it over with me?” The girl then entered He’s kitchen and prepared a meal for her mother, who left once she’d finished eating\n\nHe received a beautiful wife and was pleased, as one might expect; but the evil governor lingered in his mind, a constant cause of distress. The girl asked him what was wrong, so He related from beginning to end everything that had happened. The girl laughed and said, “Cousin Huang is the right person to take care of this, so why’re you worrying?” He asked her to explain. She replied, “I’ve heard that the governor is addicted to listening to music and to having sex with young men, which is precisely Huang’s specialty. We can offer him Huang, to eliminate his resentment and to get revenge on him as well.”\n\nHe thought that Huang might not agree to do it. “Then beg him to do it,” the girl said.\n\nThe following day, He saw Huang arrive and he prostrated himself before him in abasement. Shocked, Huang said, “We’ve been intimate in two different lives, so if I can do anything for you, there’s nothing I won’t dare undertake. Why are you suddenly behaving this way?” Then He revealed the plan to him.\n\nHuang displayed a look of reluctance. His cousin remarked, “I lost my virginity to this gentleman, and who was responsible for that? If you allow him to die, what will become of me?” Huang gave it some thought, then agreed to do it.\n\nAssembling a plan, He Zixiao quickly wrote to solicit the aid of his friend, another court official named Wang, and sent Huang to him. Wang understood his intention and set up a large banquet, inviting the governor to it. Huang was told to crossdress and to perform a court dance as though he were a beautiful woman.\n\nWishing to have sex with Huang, the governor urgently offered a considerable amount of gold to buy him, but was afraid his bid might not be enough. Wang pretended to hesitate, as though the decision was difficult for him. Finally, after a long pause, Wang told the governor that he would agree to give Huang to him. The governor was so happy that he ceased all hostilities toward He. From the moment the governor received Huang, he was never apart from him; his concubines, of whom there were more than ten, he treated like dirt. Huang was lavished like a king with feasts and gifts; he was also granted large amounts of gold.\n\nSix months later, the governor fell ill. Huang knew that the governor would be traveling the road to the underworld soon, so he took a leave and brought a carriage filled with gold and silks home to He’s family. Shortly thereafter, the governor died.\n\nUsing the wealth he’d brought back, Huang built a home and furnished it, obtained livestock and servants, and brought his mother and his cousin’s mother to live with him. Any time Huang went out, he rode in a resplendent carriage and no one knew he was really a fox.\n\nI’ll be a “judge in jest” and render this judgment: It is an important facet of human life that men and women live together as husbands and wives. Concerning the respective features of men’s and women’s sexual organs, the reasonable way to make love is between men and women. Lovers arrange for secret meetings before marrying each other, even when others will ridicule them for doing so; and where sodomy is concerned, it’s even harder for people to tolerate its shamefulness. A man certainly has to be strong to make love with a virgin male; since the anus isn’t the right channel, how can it not resist allowing something to enter it? Now, some people just forget altogether about pursuing love the right way and choose to make love homosexually. The act of sex that usually occurs between a man and a woman is then between two men, above and below, which is disgusting and against nature.\n\nRejecting a woman’s organ is like pretending to be a hermit monk who no longer has any desire; a man’s backside is barren ground, and nothing will grow there. This kind of activity is like leaving Red Hare tethered outside one’s gate, like Lü Bu shooting at the head of a halberd; you have to locate the great bow in the kingdom’s storehouse if you really want to fight your way through the pass. Otherwise, there’s the example of the student who was visited at night by his old friend the eel; and obviously there’s Wang, who drilled his red plum seeds so nothing was produced from them. When a soldier on horseback comes all at once to the Black Pine forest, of course everything seems peaceful just then; but if the tidal surge at Yellow Dragon Mansion suddenly arrives, what could withstand it? It would be better to cut off the organs that are the roots of such wickedness and use them to plug up each others’ disgusting channels.",

        "body": "Zhao, a resident of Yishui, was walking through the city on his way home when he saw a woman in white clothing crying by the roadside, extremely distraught. As he glanced at her, he noticed she was beautiful. Delighted by the sight, he continued gazing at her without leaving. With her tears dripping, the woman cried to Zhao, “Why don’t you just go on your way instead of staring at me!”\n\nZhao replied, “It’s because I see you alone here crying so sadly that my heart is deeply moved.”\n\n“My husband is dead and I’ve nowhere to go,” she said, “and that’s why I’m so distressed.” Zhao encouraged her to select another husband. The woman remarked, “I’m a widow, struggling all by myself, so how could I choose anyone? If only I could find another man to support me, I could become his concubine.” Zhao delightedly recommended himself, so the young woman agreed to follow him.\n\nZhao realized it was a long way to his home, so he wanted to find a cart for her to ride in instead of having to walk. The young woman said, “There’s no need for that.” Then she went on ahead of them, floating as swiftly as a fairy.\n\nOnce they arrived at Zhao’s home, she took charge of the housework very diligently.\n\nMore than two years later, she told Zhao, “I felt passionately moved by your affection for me, and I agreed to live with you for three years regardless of any other concerns. Now’s the right time for me to leave.”\n\nZhao said, “In the past you complained that you had no home, so where can you go to now?”\n\n“At that time,” she explained, “I spoke without thinking, for how could I actually be homeless? My father sells medicines in Jinling. If you want us to meet again, you can bring some medicinal herbs there and we can help you with your traveling expenses.” Zhao made preparations to do so and leased a horse. The woman took her leave of him, stepped outside and left directly on her way; he ran after her but couldn’t catch up, and in a flash she vanished.\n\nQuite a while passed, and he began to miss her terribly, so he made his plans to sell some medicinal herbs in Jinling. He lodged with his traveling supplies and trade goods at an inn and made inquiries throughout the streets and the market of the city. Suddenly an old man at the medicine shop saw him and cried, “My son-in-law has arrived.” Then he invited Zhao to come into his house.\n\nThe young woman, who was washing laundry in the yard, saw him and neither spoke nor smiled, but continued washing the clothes without stopping. Zhao grew indignant and hastily left. The old man went after him and dragged him back. The woman still didn’t turn around to look at him.\n\nThe old man ordered her to lay out a feast for Zhao. Just as the old man was planning to give Zhao a generous gift, the young woman stopped and said, “His fortunes are stretched and he can’t afford to take on much more; it’s only right that we give him something to relieve his hardships, and get around ten or so prescriptions for him to use, then he’ll always be able to provide for whatever he needs.” The old man asked her where Zhao’s herbs were. His daughter replied, “I’ve already sold them and here’s the money for them.”\n\nThe old man took out the prescriptions and also handed Zhao the money for the herbs, then accompanied him as he left for home. Later, when Zhao tried out his prescriptions, he found them extraordinarily effective. There was still someone in Yishui who knew how to follow such prescriptions. For one of the prescriptions, Zhao would take the mortar that was used for grinding garlic, catch the rainwater dripping from the edge of the roof in it, and then wash any warts with it, which always proved to have a good effect on them.",

        "body": "Master Tang Pin was a successful candidate in the highest level imperial examination. He had been ill for some time and was dying. Suddenly he felt a heat in his lower regions that gradually began spreading and moving up his body; when it got to his thighs, his feet became numb; when it reached his belly, his thighs became numb, too; when it arrived at his heart, he remained conscious even when his heart eventually stopped beating.\n\nHis thoughts returned to trivial things that had happened when he was quite young and which he had forgotten for a long time, till they became so vivid in his mind that he was experiencing them all over again. When the things he recalled were pleasant, he felt at peace; but once the memory was a bad one, he felt troubled and upset, like oil boiling in a cauldron.\n\nTang recalled that when he was seven or eight years old, he went one day to explore the contents of a sparrow’s nest and ended up killing a young sparrow. When he thought about this matter, he became agitated by a throbbing pain, till the guilty ache eventually passed. After he’d recalled everything that had happened in his life, he figured that he would probably die soon, but it felt like he was in a dream, and his spirit would simply exit, leaving behind his lifeless human shell.\n\nIt seemed that Tang’s ghost had become exposed to the air and was drifting aimlessly along the road at the outskirts of town. A giant that was so tall he almost couldn’t see the top of it came along, picked Tang up, and stuck him inside its sleeve. Once he was in the sleeve, Tang, unable to stretch himself out, felt like he’d been folded and compressed, which made him feel very uncomfortable and awkward.\n\nSuddenly Tang mused that only the Buddha could solve this problem, so he called the Buddha’s name until he consequently floated out of the sleeve. The giant grabbed him and stuck him back inside his sleeve again. Three times he got out and three times he was reinserted until finally the giant just left. Tang stood all alone, uncertain what to do, not knowing where he should go. He remembered that the Buddha came from India, so he headed toward the west.\n\nAfter a while, he saw a monk sitting cross-legged by the side of the road so he hurried over to pay his respects and to inquire about the route to take. The monk said, “The god of literature and Confucius are in charge of human beings’ lives, so surely those two could help you establish your reputation, and then you can get an appropriate position.” Tang asked him how to find them, and when the monk gave him directions, he hurried off to go there.\n\nShortly thereafter, he arrived at a Confucian temple and saw Confucius himself sitting there like an emperor. Confucius said to him, “Your name may be missing from the records and still come to be reverenced.” Then he pointed out the way to him. Once again, Tang hurried off.\n\nHe saw a grand palace that looked like the residence of a king. He bowed and entered, and indeed he found a holy man inside, who seemed to conduct himself like one of the gods. Tang kowtowed when he saw him. The holy one checked his name and said, “Your heart is honest and sincere, so it’s only right that you should be returned to life. But since your fleshly body is gone now, there is no one else but the goddess Guanyin who can help you return to life.” Thanks to the holy man’s encouragement, Tang was anxious to be on his way. He followed the directions the holy man gave him.\n\nPresently he saw a dense forest of long, thin bamboo and a resplendently beautiful temple. He entered it and saw a Bodhisattva adorned with a tall, spiral headdress, her features as lustrous as a full moon; willow cuttings were soaking in a vase and a mist was drifting down from an incense burner made of green jade. Tang respectfully kowtowed in obeisance, then described his experiences to the enlightened one.\n\nThe Bodhisattva told him that he only had himself to blame for what had happened. Tang sorrowfully prayed and prayed to her without stopping. Beside her stood a monk who said, “The Bodhisattva, who carries out the great dharma earnestly, can take a pinch of earth and make it flesh, and can break off a bit of willow and make it bone.”\n\nThe Bodhisattva reached out her hand and broke off a willow twig, dipped it into the water in the vase, stirred it into some dirt to make mud, and then slapped the mud onto Tang’s body. A boy who was dispatched to guide Tang on his way out of the otherworldly temple gave him a push and shut the door behind him.\n\nFrom inside Tang’s coffin there came a groan and some movement, and suddenly he was restored to health. His family members gathered around, astonished, to help him out, and they calculated that seven weeks had passed before Master Tang returned to life.",

Every few days he would apparently die, becoming stiff as a corpse, and three or four days later, he’d return to consciousness. When someone would ask him what he’d seen, he’d turn secretive and wouldn’t reveal anything. At that time in his town there was a scholar named Zhang who also died periodically. He told people, “Li Zhongzhi is the Hell King. Whenever I arrive in the underworld, he’s also there among the officials.” There was a verse on the gate of the palace there, and Zhang could recite it.\n\nSomeone asked him, “What was Li doing yesterday in the underworld?”\n\nZhang replied, “I’m not at liberty to say. But he was bringing Cao Cao to trial, and he received twenty lashes.”\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “A-man’s case is one which has been judged many times, by generations of the Hell King. The villain’s path led him to Sword Mountain, where all sorts of cruel tortures, perfectly suited to Cao Cao’s crimes, have been administered to him; so since it’s been over a thousand years, why not kill him, instead of torturing him endlessly? Cao Cao was an evil criminal, guilty of crimes for which he deserves to die ten thousand deaths. The generations of the Hell King didn’t kill him because criminals who are so evil hope they can die soon, knowing that to be tortured for a long time is much more painful than to die at once. How strange!”",

        "title": "Lian Suo",
        "body": "Yang Yuwei moved his home to the shore of the Sishui River. His study faced the open countryside and outside his wall there were many ancient graves, where at night he could hear the leaves of the white poplars rustling, sounding like waves breaking. Late one night, Yang sat alone by candlelight, despondent at being so cut off from other people. Suddenly outside his wall he heard a person’s voice reciting, “Dark night, your sad wind blows forth, sometimes the fireflies flit through the grass, sometimes they rest on the curtains.” This was repeated again and again in a clearly sorrowful tone. He heard it to be the gentle voice of a young woman. Yang didn’t know what to make of it.\n\nThe next day, he looked outside his wall and found no trace of anyone having been there. However, there was a purple band that had been caught on some brambles and left behind; Yang picked it up and went home, where he put it on his window frame.\n\nThat night, during the second watch, the reciting began like before. As Yang took a stool and climbed up on it to look over the wall, the reciting suddenly stopped. He recognized that the source must be a ghost, but he felt drawn to it anyway.\n\nThe following night, he waited in hiding behind the wall. When the first watch had come and gone, a young woman appeared from inside the bramble bush, held onto a sapling and recited pitifully with her head bowed. When Yang cleared his throat, the woman suddenly returned to the brambles and vanished. From behind the wall, Yang waited for her to finish her verse and then added his own words: “How can anyone see her private thoughts, her emotional suffering? In the moonlight, she feels the cold through her garments.” For a long time, everything was still. Yang then went inside.\n\nJust as he was sitting down, a beautiful woman entered and greeted him respectfully, saying, “Sir, you’re a steadfast and refined scholar, so I shouldn’t have been afraid of you before.” Yang was pleased to see her and gave her a seat. She was cold, so fragile and thin that she seemed too weak to support her clothes.\n\n“Where are you from and how long have you been here?” he asked.\n\n“I’m from western Gansu province,” she replied, “I followed my father here but had no permanent home. When I was seventeen, I suffered a sudden disease and died—that was more than twenty years ago. In the realms of the underworld, I’m lonely as a duck separated from the flock. I wrote the words I was reciting to express my frustration. I thought for a long time but couldn’t fit anything else to it; then you finished it for me, giving me joy in the world of the dead.”\n\nYang wanted to make love with her. She told him sadly, “I’m nothing but bones mouldering in a grave, not a living person, and making love to someone from the underworld will quickly cut short your life. I couldn’t bear to bring calamity on you.” Yang then stopped his pleading.\n\nBut he started reaching into her bosom with his hands and discovered that her breasts were as perfect as a virgin’s. Then he wanted to look under her skirt to see her tiny feet. The woman ducked her head and laughed, “You madman, you’re so naughty!” As Yang fondled them in the pale light, he saw her brocade stockings and noticed one foot had a colored thread tied around it.\n\nWhen he looked at the other one, he noticed a purple band around it. “Why do you have the thread there?” he asked.\n\nShe explained, “Last night you frightened me and when I ran away, I didn’t know that I’d lost it when it fell off there.”\n\n“That’s an easy matter to settle,” Yang declared. He reached up over the window, took the band down and gave it to her. The woman, surprised, asked how he’d come by it and he told her what had happened. Then she took off the thread and tied the band in its place.\n\nWhile looking over some of Yang’s books, she suddenly spotted _The Collected Auspicious Verses_, and, deeply moved, informed him, “When I was alive, this was my most beloved text. Seeing it now, it’s almost like I’ve only been dreaming!” As they chatted about literature, her artful cleverness made her adorable to Yang. He snuffed a candle to increase the intimacy, and they continued conversing like a longtime couple.\n\nFrom then on, each night as soon as he heard a soft voice reciting, she would instantly appear. She always cautioned him, “You must keep this a secret and say nothing to anyone. I’m rather timid and I fear some meddlesome person might want to interfere.” Yang followed her advice. The two were as happy together as fish in water, and even though they didn’t make love and sleep in the same bedroom, they seemed to be even more intimate than a married couple.\n\nThe woman helped Yang, copying his manuscripts by lamplight in exquisitely-drawn characters. She also made selections from the hundreds of verses to recite while recording them. She had Yang set up a chess board and purchase a pipa. Each night she tutored Yang’s playing—whether chess or the pipa. She played the poignant melody of “Rain Tapping at my Window,” which was just too intensely sad; Yang couldn’t bear to listen to it, so the woman switched to “Bird Songs in the Garden at Dawn,” and immediately he felt his mood lift.\n\nThey’d hang up a lantern so they could see to play, and the music often made them forget the night was passing. As they looked out the window and saw the dawn’s early light, Yang’s ghostly beloved would panic and run away.\n\nOne day, a scholar named Xue stopped to pay a visit, though Yang had taken to sleeping during the day. Xue noticed the pipa and the chessboard set up, recognizing that these were things that Yang was not good at. Then he flipped through the pages of the poetry manuscripts, noting the beautiful calligraphy of the characters, which continued to provoke his suspicions. When Yang woke up, Xue asked him, “What are the chessboard and the pipa for?”\n\n“I’ve been wanting to learn them,” Yang replied.\n\nWhen Xue asked about the pages of poetry, Yang claimed that they belonged to one of his friends. Xue paged through the poetry again, checking it over, and noticed that at the end of the final sheet, a group of delicate characters read, “Copied by Lian Suo on this date.”\n\nWith a laugh, Xue declared, “This is a woman’s name, so why’re you trying to mislead me?” Yang was greatly embarrassed and couldn’t find the words to defend himself. Xue demanded an explanation, increasing Yang’s guilty feelings, but Yang still didn’t say anything. Xue stuck the sheets under his arm, adding to Yang’s embarrassment, till finally he told him everything.\n\nXue demanded to see the ghostly woman. Yang explained that he’d promised Lian Suo to tell no one. Xue admired his loyal ardor; but Yang couldn’t stop him from insisting, so he finally gave in.\n\nAt midnight, when Lian Suo arrived, he filled her in on what had happened. Angrily, she exclaimed, “What did I tell you? That’s the end of all our time together!” Yang tried to explain his actions forthrightly. Lian Suo cried, “You’ve ended our relationship!” Yang said everything he could think of to calm her, but she remained so inconsolable that she got up and left, saying, “I have to hide for a while.”\n\nThe next day, Xue came back and Yang told him he wouldn’t be able to see Lian Suo. Xue suspected this was just an excuse, so he invited two friends at sunset to come over and stay to be entertained through the night, which disturbed Yang; though he hated being trapped this way, there seemed to be little he could do about it. The group watched for several nights but there was only a pervasive silence that left its mark on them, causing their loud noise and laughter gradually to dwindle to nothing.\n\nSuddenly one night they heard the sound of a voice reciting, and as they all listened, it proved sadly moving indeed. Xue then pricked up his ears with an expression of concentration till a certain martial artist named Wang picked up a large stone and threw it, loudly shouting, “Why don’t you show yourself so we can see you? That pitiful whining’s just depressing us!” Instantly, the voice stopped reciting.\n\nThe group was quite exasperated with Wang. Yang was particularly furious at his aggressive display. The next day, the others all departed. Alone in his study, Yang kept hoping Lian Suo would return, but there was no trace of her.\n\nAfter more than two days, she suddenly came back weeping and cried, “You invited your horrible guests, and this is what their intimidation has done to me!” Yang apologized for not being able to act in time to stop Wang. Lian Suo hurried to leave, saying, “I’ve already told you that our connection’s been severed and I must leave you.” Yang tried to pull her to him, but she’d already disappeared.\n\nA month passed and still she didn’t return. Yang, thinking of her constantly but unable to contact her, became emaciated. One night as he was alone drinking wine, Lian Suo suddenly pulled aside the curtain and entered the room. Deliriously happy, Yang pleaded, “Have you seen fit to forgive me?”\n\nLian Suo’s tears fell down her chest as she remained silent, speaking not a word. Yang repeated his questions, desperately desiring some response, till she replied, “I was speaking out of frustration when I left, so now that I’m in trouble and asking for help, it’s hard to avoid feeling ashamed.” Yang asked her again and again what she meant before she explained, “You didn’t know about it, but I’ve had to put up with a horrible ghost who’s trying to force me to be his concubine. I wish to protect my virginity, so how can I allow my body to be abused as some ghost’s slave? Yet I’m thin and frail, so how can I resist him? Rather than allow him to have his way with me, surely you won’t let me struggle alone.”\n\nYang was so infuriated that he was ready to kill the ghost, but when he thought about the differences between mortals and ghosts, he wasn’t sure he had the power to carry it off. Lian Suo told him, “Go to bed early and I’ll guide you in your dreams.” Then they spent the evening together in heart-to-heart conversation, sitting together until daybreak. As Lian Suo was about to leave, she reminded Yang that he must not fall asleep during the day, but must wait for their rendezvous that night. Yang promised to do as she said.\n\nWhen the afternoon light began to wane, he started drinking and once he was drunk, he climbed onto his bed, still dressed, fell back and went to sleep. Suddenly Lian Suo arrived, gave him a sword to wear at his waist, and then took his hand to lead him away.\n\nOnce they arrived at a courtyard and shut the gate behind them, someone began pounding at the gate with a stone. Lian Suo cried, “Our enemy is here!” When Yang opened the gate and rushed out, he saw a man dressed in the attire of a yamen runner, with a bristly beard surrounding his mouth.\n\nThey began yelling at each other in rage. The ghost stared angrily as they exchanged fierce insults. Yang, furious, went straight for his opponent. The ghost began snatching up stones and flinging them so they fell like a sudden and heavy rainstorm, till one smashed Yang’s wrist and he could no longer hold his sword.\n\nThen, while facing imminent disaster, he spotted a man in the distance who was armed with bow and arrow. Upon closer examination, he could tell it was Wang, the martial artist. Yang called to him for rescue. Wang drew his bow and quickly fired, sending an arrow into the ghost’s thigh; he shot a second time and killed it.\n\nYang, greatly relieved, expressed his gratitude. Wang asked him what what had happened, so Yang described the situation to him. Wang was glad to have redeemed himself for his earlier discourtesy and followed Yang into Lian Suo’s home. She had cautiously withdrawn from the combat, timidly standing at a distance without making a sound.\n\nOn a table there was a short sword, about a _chi_ long, its hilt decorated with gold and jade; when it was taken entirely out of its display case, it reflected the light like a bronze mirror. Wang praised it highly and couldn’t help gripping it tightly for a long time. Yang exchanged words with him briefly, but seeing Lian Suo, they took pity on her fearful shyness and went outside, then parted company and left.\n\nYang went home and fell down when climbing over his wall, which startled him awake to the sound of the village roosters crowing. He felt a sharp pain in his wrist; at daybreak, he looked at it and found the flesh to be red and swollen.\n\nLate in the afternoon, Wang came over and reported that he’d had a strange dream the previous night. “Did you dream about shooting your bow?” Yang asked. Wang was shocked by his prescience. Yang showed Wang his wrist and described what had happened to it. Wang recalled Lian Suo’s face from his dream, but he was sorry that he hadn’t gotten a better look at her; since it had been his good fortune to help her, he wanted Yang to put in a good word for him so he could see her again.\n\nThat night, Lian Suo arrived to thank Yang. He gave credit for the rescue to Wang, then informed her of Wang’s sincere desire to see her again. Lian Suo replied, “Since I received his help, it wouldn’t be right just to ignore him. At the same time, his aggressive nature really scares me.” She added, “He seemed quite attracted to my short sword. It was given to me while my father was an envoy in Guangdong province, where he purchased it for a hundred taels. I was fond of it and had it ornamented with gold and pearls. My father understood its importance to me and buried it with me when I died. Now I hope to make Wang a present of it, parting with what I love, so his seeing it will be like seeing me.”\n\nThe next day Yang sent word to Wang of Lian Suo’s intentions. Wang was utterly amazed. When night fell, she brought the short sword with her, telling Yang, “Instruct him to treasure this, for it didn’t come from China.” Henceforward, Lian Suo and Yang resumed their relationship as before.\n\nSeveral months went by till one night by lamplight, Lian Suo smiled at Yang as though wanting to say something, then, blushing, stopped short, repeating the action several times. He hugged her and asked her what was on her mind. “For a long time,” she replied, “you’ve treated me with love, bearing my ghostly presence and making me part of the human world, till now my dead bones suddenly have a little vitality. I only need some semen and blood from a living person and I can return to life.”\n\nLaughing, Yang said, “I wasn’t the one who resisted sex—wasn’t I keen on it?”\n\nLian Suo informed him, “Once we make love, you’ll be severely ill for some time, but with medicine, you can recover.” Then they made love gleefully.\n\nAfterwards, when they got up and were dressing, she reminded him, “I still need a little bit of your blood, so can you risk life and pain to do that for me?” Yang applied a sharp knife to his arm until blood came out; Lian Suo lay on the bed so the blood could drip into her navel. When there was enough, she got up and told him, “I can’t come back here again. In exactly one hundred days, you must remember to be watching at my grave, and when a bluebird begins to sing in the treetop there, you must immediately dig up my grave.” Yang listened to her instructions carefully. As she walked through the gate, she urged him again, “Please don’t forget, you mustn’t dig too late or too early!” Then she vanished.\n\nOver ten days later, Yang became ill and his belly became so swollen and painful that he wanted to die. A doctor gave him medicine which caused him to expel a foul, mud-like effluence, and as the medicine penetrated over time, he recovered.\n\nIn a hundred days, as planned, he went to the grave with servants carrying spades. He waited all day long and then he saw a bluebird that sang twice. Yang happily cried out, “Okay, now.” Then they cut down the brambles and dug open her grave. He discovered a decayed wooden coffin, but inside it, Lian Suo looked alive. She felt slightly warm to his touch.\n\nHe wrapped her up in clothing and carried her home, and once he’d set her in a warm place, she began to breathe ever so shallowly. She was able to take some soup, one sip at a time, and by midnight she was completely revived. Later she kept saying to Yang from time to time, “The last twenty years have been like a dream.”",

        "body": "Master Han came from a famous family whose members had been officials generation after generation in Zichuan district. There was a Daoist priest named Shan who gave public performances and Han loved to watch him work his magic, so he’d take a seat among the distinguished guests. Shan would have someone participate by coming over and sitting down, then he’d make himself invisible. Han wanted to be taught this ability, but Shan wouldn’t consent. Han remained adamant in his request.\n\nShan told him, “I’m not stingy with my magic, but I fear my Daoist power might prove harmful. I could teach you, and then you’d be able to do it for yourself; you’d be able to ‘borrow’ things, which would really just mean stealing them. You certainly wouldn’t give that a second thought, then you might go out looking for a beauty whose looks pleased you so you could make yourself invisible and enter her bedroom, to pursue your evil purpose and rape her. I’m afraid I cannot comply with your request.”\n\nHan couldn’t respond violently right there, but in his heart he harbored a hatred of the Daoist, and with his servants he secretly plotted revenge on him. He was afraid Shan might escape him by concealing himself, so he spread fine ashes over the ground: that way, even if Shan made himself invisible, when he walked through the area he’d certainly leave footprints and Han could follow them to a place where he could quickly and violently attack him. Hence he worked to lure Shan out, so he could have the servants flog the Daoist brutally with a leather-thonged whip.\n\nWhen Shan suddenly disappeared and his footprints appeared in the ashes, Han told the servants to lash out frantically left and right, but he quickly realized that he had no idea where the Daoist had gone. Han went home, and Shan did the same.\n\nShan told all his servants, “I can no longer stay here! In the past, I’ve put you to the trouble of serving me, and now that I must leave, I wish to offer you some recompense.” With a flourish, he took out a jar of excellent liquor from inside his sleeve, and then reached forward a deep dish filled with delicacies, setting them both out on a table. Once he’d laid them there he brought out some more; altogether he did this many times, till the table was full. Then he invited the group to drink until they all became drunk; afterwards he put each of the dishes away as before inside his sleeve. Han heard of this magical display and sent his servants to summon him to give another performance.\n\nShan drew a picture of a city upon his wall, and when he knocked at it with his hand, the gate in the city wall suddenly opened up. Taking a bag of clothing and a small trunk of belongings, he tossed them through the gate, respectfully saluted Han’s servants with folded hands, and then declared, “I’m leaving now!” He leapt through the open wall, and as the gate closed after him, the priest abruptly vanished.\n\nAfterwards they heard that at the market in Qingzhou, Shan taught some children to paint ink circles in their palms and then to toss them at other people, and wherever the circles landed, whether on their faces or on their clothes, the ink circles would disappear, though faint vestiges of them remained behind.\n\nThey also heard that with his magic, Shan had been able to command his bladder to fill up with strong alcohol, so he could drain an entire wine jar. Han tried to find an opportunity to see this in person."

A court official named Ge read some of his writing, praised it enthusiastically, and asked someone who knew Wu to deliver an invitation for Wu to visit his home so he could discuss Wu’s literary talents frankly with him. He remarked, “How can Wu be so talented and have remained poor for so long?” Hence he asked someone standing nearby to “Pass a message to Qing’an, saying that if he can dedicate himself successfully to earn the highest achievement in the imperial civil service examination, he will be welcome to marry my daughter.” Indeed, Ge had a very lovely daughter.\n\nWu heard the offer with great joy and felt very confident. Subsequently, however, he failed the following autumn’s examination, then sent someone to tell Ge, “I will be more fortunate on another occasion, since that is my fate, and it is only a matter of time, sooner or later. Please be patient for three years, and if I cannot succeed by then, you should marry your daughter to someone else.” Wu became even more sincerely committed to studying.\n\nOne night as the moon was shining brightly, a _xiucai_ came to visit Wu, a man with a pale complexion and a short beard, slender, with long fingers. When Wu asked him who he was, he introduced himself: “I’m Bai Yuyu.” Soon they were engaged in an earnest conversation, and Wu was impressed with Bai’s broadmindedness.\n\nDelighted by their exchange, Wu invited him to stay for the night. At dawn, as Bai was preparing to leave, Wu urged him to stop by any time he was passing that way. Bai was moved by his generous kindness and when he expressed his hope that he might move in to live with Wu, they settled upon a date for him to do so, and Bai then took his leave.\n\nOn the appointed day, the first arrival was a servant delivering cooking utensils. After a little while Bai appeared, riding a steed as noble as a dragon. Wu assigned some separate rooms for Bai. Bai in turn directed a servant to lead his horse away. They were together then from morning till night, delighted that they got along so well.\n\nWu observed that the books Bai read were not common ones and had no connection to the eight-part essays included in the civil service examination. He was surprised and asked his friend about it. Bai smiled and replied, “Every scholar has his own aspirations, and I’m just an ordinary fellow, not interested in advancement.”\n\nOne night as Wu was inviting him to drink up, Bai took out and gave to Wu a book which dealt with breathing techniques that ensured longevity, and since many were rather obtuse, Wu found it rather slow-going and set it aside. Sometime later, Bai told Wu, “Last time I gave you a source that contains the essential points of _The Classic of the Yellow Court_, which can guide you on the difficult journey to the land of the immortals.”\n\nSmiling, Wu said, “That’s not what I’m interested in at the moment. Those who seek immortality must sever their emotional ties with this world, leaving themselves utterly alone, and I couldn’t bring myself to do that.”\n\n“Why not?” Bai asked. Wu explained he was simply thinking of his duty to carry on the family line. “Then why haven’t you married yet?” Bai responded.\n\nWith a laugh, Wu explained, “‘I have a weakness—I love women.’”\n\nBai laughed, too, replying, “‘Your Majesty shouldn’t indulge in petty lusts.’ So what’s your real love like?”\n\nWu told him his feelings about Ge’s daughter. Bai was skeptical that she was really as beautiful as he claimed. Wu insisted, “Far and near, everyone’s heard of her, it’s not just my impression.” Bai gave a small smile and pushed no further.\n\nThe next day he hurriedly packed his things and prepared to depart. Wu was so upset that he just kept talking and couldn’t stop himself. Bai then told a servant boy to take his things and go on ahead. Both men were reluctant to part from the other. At that moment, they saw a green cicada land on the table, and Bai made ready to leave by saying, “My carriage has come to pick me up, so I have to say farewell now. If you wish to think of me sometimes, just lay down on my bed and go to sleep.”\n\nJust as Wu was about to ask what he meant, in a twinkling Bai became as small as a finger and lightly straddled the cicada’s back, which began chirping and flew off, disappearing into the clouds. Wu then realized that Bai was no ordinary person and stood there, stunned, for a good long time, depressed and at a loss about what to do.\n\nAfter several days, it was drizzling, and Wu could think of nothing but Bai. When he looked down on Bai’s bed, all he saw was a scattering of rat tracks; with a sigh he swept them off, unrolled the mattress and lay down to sleep. Before long, he saw Bai’s servant boy coming to guide him and he happily followed.\n\nSuddenly as they watched a hummingbird gathering nectar from many sources, the boy caught it, advising Wu, “It’s difficult to travel in the dark, but you can ride this as your transport.” Wu worried that it was so tiny it couldn’t possibly carry him. The boy insisted, “Just give it a try.” Wu did as he suggested, finding that there was plenty of room for him, and the boy joined him near the bird’s tail; to the sound of its call, they lifted off and soared into the sky.\n\nBefore long, they spotted a red gate and landed. The boy dismounted first and then helped Wu climb down. “What is this place?” asked Wu.\n\n“This is the gate of the heavenly palace,” replied the boy. A huge tiger lay crouching beside the gate. Wu was terrified, so the boy used his own body to shield him. Wu saw that in every respect, the scenery was extraordinary.\n\nThe boy led him into the Moon Palace, and once they were inside, its crystal stair steps made Wu feel like he was walking on mirrors. There were two cassia trees that were too large to wrap one’s arms around; the scent of flowers filled the air, their fragrance absolutely otherworldly. From the red-windowed pavilions and rooms, beauties periodically were going out and coming in, their seductive make-up and gorgeous figures combining for unrivalled loveliness.\n\n“The Queen Mother’s palace beauties are especially wonderful,” noted the boy. Then, afraid that he’d kept his master waiting too long, he ended their leisurely lingering and hurriedly led Wu outside.\n\nShortly afterwards they saw Bai waiting near a gate. He took Wu’s hand and they went inside, where Wu saw a babbling brook of crystal clear water flowing over white sands; with its white marble steps and carved railings, it looked very much like the Moon Palace.\n\nJust as they sat down, a sixteen-year-old beauty brought them some fragrant tea. Bai then asked to have wine poured for them. Four beauties came out and bowed respectfully, their earrings tinkling, then stood nearby to serve them. When Wu felt a small itch in his back, a beauty immediately slipped her delicate, long-nailed fingers under his clothing and scatched the place for him. Wu felt exhilarated as she took care of the itch.\n\nSince he was a little drunk, he gradually lost control of himself, grinning and gawking at the beauties, chatting with them flirtaciously. The beauties, however, just laughed and avoided him. Bai requested a song from the girls and encouraged Wu to drink up. One beauty dressed in crimson silk turned to face Wu and came over near him, then turned and started singing. All the other beauties accompanied her raucously on musical pipes, honking assorted harmonies.\n\nWhen she finished, another girl in a jade green skirt poured more wine and sang. There was yet another one dressed in purple and a pale beauty in thin white silk, giggling together, neither wanting to be the next to perform. Bai ordered one of them to pour more wine and the other to sing.\n\nThe one in purple then came over to pick up Wu’s cup. He held it up for her, then playfully grabbed her slender wrist. The girl laughed and as he lost hold of her, the wine cup was tipped over. Bai scolded her. The girl picked up the cup with a smile, lowered her head and whispered, “As cold as a ghost’s hand—why’d you grab my arm?” Bai laughed loudly and as punishment told her both to sing and to dance for them.\n\nWhen she finished dancing, the girl in the white silk rushed over to fill their cups. Wu declined since he couldn’t drink another round. The girl, holding the wine vessel in both hands, blushed in awkward embarrassment, so Wu went ahead and tossed down another cup.\n\nHe gazed carefully at the four beauties with their graceful bearing, every one of them unmatched in beauty. Then he turned quickly to Bai and said, “In the mortal world, such rare beauties are difficult for me to find; yet you’ve collected a whole bevy of beautiful women, and if I could have one of them, could I really make love with her?”\n\nBai laughed and replied, “You already have your own beauty—who here could possibly compare with her?”\n\n“Now,” Wu replied, “I realize that I haven’t actually seen all that many girls.”\n\nBai then gathered all the girls together so Wu could choose one of them. Wu was so overwhelmed that he couldn’t make up his mind. Since Wu had flirted with the beauty in purple by grabbing her arm, Bai decided to send her with a quilt to entertain their guest.\n\nSubsequently, lying under a large quilt as they made passionate love, Wu fell in love with her. He begged her for some kind of love remembrance, so the girl took the gold bracelet off her wrist and gave it to him.\n\nSuddenly the boy servant came in and reported, “Immortals and mortals must follow very different paths—you have to go now.” The girl leapt up and quickly ran off. Wu asked about Bai and the boy explained, “First thing this morning, he had to visit the celestial court, so when he left he asked me to see you off.” Disappointed, Wu went with him, returning by the route they’d previously taken.\n\nJust as they reached the heavenly gate, Wu turned to look at the boy without having realized that he had already vanished. When the mighty tiger roared and suddenly stood up, Wu fled in terror. He abruptly felt a bottomless void beneath his feet and was falling in his panic.\n\nWith a shock he awoke, the morning sun shining brightly in his courtyard. As he was shaking out his clothing to dress, something small fell out on his bed and upon examination he realized it was the girl’s bracelet. He found this exceedingly strange. After this, he became distracted and listless, yet he still wanted a son, since the burden of continuing his family line remained a worry for him.\n\nOver ten months passed, and when Wu drank himself to sleep one afternoon, he dreamed that the beautiful girl in purple stood just outside his room, cradling a baby to her breast, saying, “This is your flesh and blood. There’s no place in heaven for this child, so I’m respectfully delivering him to you.” Then she laid it to sleep on his bed, pulling the bedclothes up to tuck it in, and obviously wished to go.\n\nWu held her tightly and wanted to make love. She told him, “The first time was our wedding night, and now it’s time for us to part, though we were husband and wife in this lifetime. But if you’re ambitious enough, perhaps you’ll see me another time.”\n\nWu woke up, and seeing the baby lying with him on the bed, hugged it close and went to tell his mother. She was overjoyed and hired a nurse to feed the infant, who was named Mengxian. Consequently, Wu sent someone to tell Ge that since he’d decided to live as a recluse, the court official should select another husband for his daughter. Ge, however, refused to do so.\n\nWu firmly reiterated his position. Ge told his daughter this, and she replied, “Far and near, everyone knows I’ve been promised to Master Wu. To change that now would be like marrying a second husband.”\n\nGe relayed her message to Wu. “Not only do I no longer have any ambition for official rank,” Wu explained, “but, cruel though it may seem, I also do not wish to be married. The only reason I haven’t already gone into seclusion in the mountains is out of consideration for my aged mother.”\n\nGe also reported this to his daughter. She answered, “If Master Wu is poor, I’ll gladly eat whatever coarse food he can afford; if he leaves home, I’ll make it my duty to care for his mother: I’m determined to marry no one else.” People were sent back and forth three or four times without any concrete result, then Ge chose an auspicious day, prepared vehicles and horses to carry the dowry, and transported his daughter to her new home.\n\nWu was moved by her loyalty to him and came to love and respect her. She was filially devoted to his mother and comported herself with absolute obedience, beyond what might be expected from even the daughter of an impoverished home.\n\nWhen two years elapsed, Wu’s mother died, so his wife pawned her dowry to arrange for funeral expenses, a modest act admired by everyone. Wu exclaimed, “With a wife as wonderful as you, I have nothing to worry about! I care for you so much that once I attain enlightenment, our whole family can join me as immortals. I must take a distant journey now, so I’m turning everything over to you.” His wife remained calm and didn’t urge him to stay. Wu consequently departed.\n\nOutside their home his wife managed to make a living, while inside she raised a child by herself, handling everything very effectively. Mengxian grew up to be peerlessly intelligent. At the age of fourteen, this prodigy passed the provincial level civil service examination, and at fifteen, he was admitted to the Hanlin Academy. He was frequently praised, and honors were conferred on him; since he didn’t know his birth mother’s surname, the honors were also conferred on Ge’s daughter, the mother who raised him.\n\nIt happened that over time, Mengxian often asked about his father, till his mother decided it was time to tell him everything. As a result, Mengxian wanted to resign his position and go to look for him. His mother told him, “Your father left here more than ten years ago now, and even supposing that he’s among the immortals, where could you possibly look for him?”\n\nAfterwards, he accepted an imperial decree to offer sacrifices on Mt. Heng, but along the way he ran into bandits. In the midst of this great danger, a Daoist appeared, swinging a sword, and the bandits were utterly routed, fleeing in all directions. Extremely grateful, Mengxian wanted to offer him some gold, but he wouldn’t accept it.\n\nThe Daoist took out a letter and gave it to the young man, explaining, “I have an old friend who lives in your village, so I’d like to send this with my greetings.”\n\n“What’s his name?” asked Mengxian.\n\n“Wang Lin,” said the Daoist. Mengxian couldn’t recall that there was anyone in the village by that name. The Daoist replied, “He’s just a lowly commoner, so an influential official like you wouldn’t know him.” As he was about to go, he took out a gold bracelet and said, “This lady’s item is something I picked up, but since it’s no use to me, I’d like to offer it to you.” Mengxian examined it, noting its inlay and engraving, exquisite in every detail.\n\nHe took it home to show it to his wife. She loved it, for its style and craftsmanship were incomparably exquisite. She asked artisans to make a duplicate bracelet for her, with the same attributes as the original. But no matter how carefully they tried, they couldn’t imitate it exactly.\n\nMengxian asked all over the village, but there was no evidence of any person there named Wang Lin. In private, he opened up the envelope and the letter read: “For three years we were husband and wife, then we were separated by heaven; you buried my mother and raised my son, so I’ve relied entirely upon your virtuousness. I cannot repay your kindness, so I respectfully offer you this medicinal pill: take it out and swallow it, and you can join me as an immortal.”\n\nThe back of the letter was addressed “To Lin, Mother and Wife.” When Mengxian finished reading it, he had no idea who the named person was, so he decided he’d tell his mother about it.\n\nHis mother wept as she held the letter, explaining, “This is from your father. Lin’s the name I was given at birth.” It suddenly dawned on Mengxian how he’d been fooled by the Daoist’s “Wang Lin” puzzle. He deeply regretted that he hadn’t worked it out on his own.\n\nThen he also showed his mother the bracelet. She explained, “Your birth mother left this with your father. He was still a mortal at that time, so he often showed it to me.”\n\nThey took a look at the pill, which was the size of a bean. Mengxian was delighted and exclaimed, “My father’s become an immortal, and if you swallow this, then surely you’ll also live forever.” But rather than hastily gulp it down, his mother took and hid it.\n\nWhen court official Ge came to see his grandson, his daughter read Wu’s letter to him, then took out the longevity pill. Ge cut the pill in half and split it with his daughter. In a moment, they began to glow with its essence. Ge was seventy years old and quite decrepit; suddenly he felt his muscles growing firm beneath his skin, so he left his carriage and stepped out by himself, his paces strong and quick, with the servants gasping for breath as they tried to keep up with him.\n\nOnce the New Year had come and gone, a disastrous fire occurred in the capital that burned all day and still hadn’t been put out. That night, Wu’s family didn’t dare go to sleep, so they all gathered in their courtyard. They could see the flames spreading all over, approaching their neighbors’ homes. The entire family was pacing frantically, not knowing what to do.\n\nSuddenly the gold bracelet on the arm of Mengxian’s mother made a clanging sound, came off her arm, and flew away. As they watched it from a distance, it became so large, it covered several _mu_; it encircled the family’s buildings overhead, like a halo around the moon; everyone could clearly see that its clasp was facing the southeast. The group was stunned.\n\nAn instant later, fire flared up from the west and as it came close to the buildings below the bracelet, it was deflected back toward the east. They waited for the fire to recede into the distance, privately believing the bracelet was gone forever; suddenly they saw a red light intensify and with a clang the bracelet fell at their feet.\n\nIn the capital, the fire’s spread destroyed several thousand homes, and on either side, in front and behind the Wu’s grounds, there was nothing but ashes and cinders, and only their buildings were untouched—with the exception of a small pavilion on the southeast side, which had been blackened in the place where the bracelet’s clasp had been located.\n\nWhen Mengxian’s mother turned fifty, anyone who saw her took her to be a person who was about twenty.",

        "body": "There was a man in Jiaozhou named Xu, who conducted his business on the seas as a trader. On a particular occasion, he was caught in a mighty gale that swept his ship away. When he opened his eyes to see where he’d landed, he found himself in the remote portions of a misty mountain. Hoping he’d run into some local people, he took the mooring rope from his boat and began to climb the mountain, carrying some bread and dried meat on his back.\n\nOn the side he ascended, he could see two cliffs riddled with cave mouths like the openings in bees’ honeycomb; from inside them came the sounds of people. When he arrived just outside one of the caves, he stopped and peered inside where he saw two yakshas, their many teeth like rows of halberds, their eyes flashing like a pair of lanterns. They were tearing apart a live deer with their claws and devouring it.\n\nXu was terrified to his very soul and desperately wanted to run down the mountain, but one of the yakshas stopped eating and spotted him, then dragged him inside. The two creatures communicated in bestial grunts and then began to tear at his clothing like they wanted to eat him. Xu, terrified, reached into his bag for some of the food he’d brought and offered them some dried meat.\n\nThey ate what he distributed and found it very satisfying. When they returned to ransack Xu’s bag, he shook his hands at them to indicate that he didn’t have any more. The yakshas grew angry and grabbed him again. Xu woefully begged them, “Let me go. There’s a rice cauldron on my boat, and I can use it to cook for you.” The yakshas couldn’t understand his words, so they remained angry.\n\nXu then resorted to sign language, and the creatures seemed to understand a bit. They followed him to his boat, where he found the cauldron and subsequently carried it back to their cave, collected some kindling and lit a fire, then cooked the rest of the deer and presented it to them. The two gobbled it gleefully.\n\nWhen night fell they took a huge stone and blocked up the cave entrance to prevent Xu from escaping. He lay down and curled up far away from the two yakshas, deeply afraid that they would eat him sooner or later. At daybreak, the two creatures went out, once again blocking up their cave.\n\nIn a short while they carried in a deer carcass and handed it over to Xu. He skinned the deer, and from deep in a natural cistern he drew water for seething it in his cauldron. He cooked several cauldrons-full of deer. Soon several other yakshas arrived and settled into feasting on the deer, all of them pointing at the cauldron to indicate that it was too small.\n\nAfter three or four days, one of the yakshas hauled in a huge cauldron which resembled the one Xu had brought from the human world. Consequently, the various yakshas all sent him their game, whether wolf or wild dog. Once it was prepared, they’d yell for him to come eat it with them.\n\nAfter Xu had been with them for some time, the yakshas got used to having him cook for them and no longer shut him in when they went out, living with him like they were all family members. Little by little, Xu was able to recognize the sounds and significance of their grunts and to imitate their sounds, eventually speaking the yaksha language.\n\nThe yakshas were exceedingly pleased by this, so they brought him a lady yaksha to be his wife. At first, Xu was appalled at the idea, yet didn’t dare admit it; but then the lady yaksha opened her thighs for him and he had sex with her. This made the lady yaksha very happy. She always saved some of her meat for him, and their relationship developed quite well.\n\nOne day, all of the yakshas got up early, each one hanging a necklace of brilliant pearls around its neck, and then in shifts they went in and out of the cave entrance as if anticipating some honored guest. They instructed Xu to cook up lots of meat. When he asked the lady yaksha what was happening, she replied, “This is our king’s birthday.”\n\nShe went out and told the assembled yakshas, “Xu doesn’t have one of our necklaces.” The others picked five pearls each from their necklaces and gave them to the lady yaksha. She then removed ten of her own pearls for a total of fifty altogether, which she strung together with some wild ramie fibers and then hung around Xu’s neck. When he took a good look at the necklace, Xu realized that each pearl was probably worth a hundred or more taels. Soon, all the yakshas went out together.\n\nWhen Xu was finished preparing the meat, the lady yaksha drew him outside with the words, “Come see our sovereign.” They came to a large cave that was several _mu_ in expanse. In the center of it there was a stone smooth enough to serve as a table; all around it there were other stones to sit on; one stone was covered with a leopard pelt, the others with deer hides. Twenty or thirty yakshas filled the seats.\n\nIn a short while, a great wind stirred up the dust and the agitated yakshas rushed outside. They watched a huge yaksha arrive, and soon he hurried into the cave to take a seat, watching the others like a hawk. The group of yakshas followed him inside and stood flanking him, holding their heads up expectantly, their arms crossed in respect.\n\nThe enormous yaksha turned his head to check out each of them and asked, “Is the contingent from Mt. Womei present?” The others declared that it was. Upon spotting Xu, the big yaksha demanded, “What’s he doing here?”\n\nThe lady yaksha replied that Xu was her “husband.” The group praised Xu’s cooking skills. At once, two or three of the yakshas rushed off to get the cooked meat and laid it out on the stone table. Picking up meat with both hands, the yaksha sovereign ate his fill and enthusiastically lauded its excellence, additionally ordering such fare to be offered more often.\n\nHe took another look at Xu and asked, “Why’s his necklace so short?”\n\n“He just got here, so we haven’t had time to prepare one,” the others replied defensively. Taking the string of pearls from around his own neck, the large yaksha removed ten of them and handed them to Xu, each of them as big as a thumb and perfectly round. The lady yaksha quickly added them to Xu’s necklace, then placed them around his neck.\n\nXu replied with the yakshas’ own crossed-arm salute and thanked the sovereign in the yaksha language. The yaksha leader then took his leave, stepped into the wind and vanished as speedily as if he’d flown away. The other yakshas took great pleasure in finishing up the remaining food before going their separate ways.\n\nXu had made his home there for over four years when the lady yaksha suddenly gave birth to a litter of yakshas, two male and one female, each of them human in appearance, unlike their mother. The yakshas were all affectionate towards Xu’s offspring, patting or playing with them all the time.\n\nOne day, they all went out to hunt while Xu stayed behind by himself. Suddenly a lady yaksha from some other cave came in, wanting to have sex with him, but Xu refused her. Infuriated, the lady yaksha attacked him, and Xu fell to the ground. Xu’s mate rushed in from outside and in a violent rage attacked the other yaksha, biting off her ear. Soon thereafter, another yaksha returned to the cave, heard what had happened and forced the intruder to leave. From then on, the lady yaksha always protected Xu, ensuring that they were never apart.\n\nIn another three years, the children were able to walk on their own. Xu taught them the language of humans and they gradually learned to speak it in their twittering voices, though in other respects they seemed just like human beings. Although they were still just children, they could run up mountains as though walking on level roads. Xu and his offspring were very close.\n\nOne day, the lady yaksha took one of the boys and the girl and went out, but half the day passed without their return. Soon the north wind began to blow. Xu’s thoughts turned melancholic, longing for home, so he took his son to the seashore, and when he saw that his boat was still there, he determined to make his way home with his son. The boy wanted to go tell his mother, but Xu stopped him.\n\nFather and son climbed into the boat and after a day and a night, they reached Jiaozhou. When he arrived home, Xu found out that his wife had already remarried. He took two pearls from his necklace and sold them for a large fortune in gold, so he and his son lived comfortably.\n\nXu named his son Biao. When Biao was only fourteen or fifteen years old, he could pick up a weight of one hundred _jun_, was impulsive, and loved to fight. When Jiaozhou’s head of military affairs saw him, he thought Biao quite extraordinary, and gave him the command of a large force. When there was a rebellion along one of their borders while he was on duty, he led his forces victoriously in quelling it, and at the age of eighteen he was made vice-general of a brigade.\n\nIn time, another trader became caught in a storm at sea and was also picked up by the wind and deposited near Mt. Womei. When he came ashore, he saw a young man staring at him in amazement. The young man learned that the man was Chinese, so he asked him about his hometown. The trader told him where he was from. The young man conducted him through a deep, secluded valley, to a small stone cave with thick brambles growing outside it; then the young man cautioned him not to go outside.\n\nAfterwards he left and returned shortly, carrying in deer meat for the trader to eat. The young man told the trader, “My father was also from Jiaozhou.”\n\nThe trader asked his father’s name, and when he learned it was Xu, he revealed that he had met him in his hometown. “Xu’s an old friend of mine,” he declared. “His son is now vice-general of a brigade.” The young man didn’t understand what it meant to be a vice-general.\n\n“He’s a Chinese official,” the trader explained.\n\nThe young man asked again, “What’s an official?”\n\n“Whenever he goes out, he travels by carriage,” explained the trader; “he wanders halls with lofty ceilings; a page attends on him and hundreds obey his directives; when he looks on them, the others avert their eyes and don’t dare raise them: this is what we call an official.” The young man was very excited to hear all this. The trader asked him, “Since your father’s in Jiaozhou, why do you stay here?”\n\nThe young man described his family situation. The trader advised him to come home with him to Jiaozhou. “I’ve often thought about it,” the young man answered, “but my mother’s not Chinese, and her language and looks are unusual; besides, if the other yakshas find out, they’ll surely tear us apart: that’s why I’ve thought about it over and over.” As they went outside, he told the trader, “Wait for the north wind to rise, then I’ll come see you off on your way. If I can trouble you to visit my father and elder brother, I have some news I’d like to send them.”\n\nThe trader laid low in the cave for almost half a year. Now and then he’d peer out through the brambles and see yakshas going here and there all over the mountain; terrified, he wouldn’t dare budge even a little.\n\nOne day, the north wind began to blow, and the young man suddenly appeared, urgently guiding the trader out to make his escape. He reminded the man, “Don’t forget to deliver my message.” The trader assured him he’d take care of it. Then the young man set some meat on the table in the boat and the trader set sail for home.\n\nWhen he arrived in Jiaozhou and reached the vice-general’s office, he reported everything he’d seen. Biao listened, saddened by the news, and wanted to go locate his other family members. His father tried to dissuade him because of all the monsters gathered together on the mountain and the danger that they might attack and defeat him with their power. But Biao wept so pitifully that his father didn’t have the heart to stop him.\n\nHence he informed his superior in Jiaozhou of his intentions, took two soldiers with him and sailed away. With headwinds hindering their boat’s progress, they bobbed and rolled in the waves for half a month. There was no sign of land in any direction and they were close to desperation, unable to distinguish south from north.\n\nUnexpectedly, a tidal bore swept over the men and the boat capsized. Biao fell into the sea and was washed along by the waves. After a long time, he was pulled from the water by some kind of thing, and eventually they arrived at a place where there were some buildings. Biao recognized that the thing looked like a yaksha. Thus he said something to it in the yaksha tongue.\n\nThe shocked yaksha asked him how he knew the language, so Biao told him where he was trying to go. The yaksha happily informed him, “I’m from Womei. I certainly don’t mean to offend you, but you’ve come up short of your goal by eight thousand _li_. This way, which leads to the Poison Dragon Kingdom, isn’t the direction to take to Womei.”\n\nThen he located a boat to carry Biao. As the yaksha got into the water behind the boat, he pushed it forward like a speeding arrow, covering a thousand _li_ in a flash, and in the passing of a single night they arrived at the north shore of Womei.\n\nThey spotted a young man who stood looking out to sea. Biao knew there was no one of the young man’s race on the mountain, so he suspected that he might be his younger brother; as he came closer, he realized he was right. They clasped each other’s hands tearfully. Biao asked about his mother and sister and was assured that both were in good health. He wanted his brother to go with him to see them, but the young man indicated he couldn’t and then hastily left. When Biao returned to thank the yaksha for his help, he, too, was gone.\n\nShortly thereafter, his mother and sister appeared together and upon seeing Biao, began to weep. Biao told them the reasons for his being there. His mother replied, “I’m afraid that if I were to go there, the people would insult me.”\n\n“In China, I’m a very well-respected person,” explained Biao, “so people wouldn’t dare belittle you.”\n\nBut once their plans for returning home were settled, fierce headwinds kept them from making their voyage. They were unable to decide what to do, when suddenly they saw the sail cloth move as the wind shifted to the south, accompanied by a gusting sound. Biao happily cried, “Heaven’s helping us!” Together they climbed aboard the boat, which proceeded to slice through the waves like a speeding arrow; they arrived at Jiaozhou in three days.\n\nEveryone who saw them ran away. Biao quickly took off his robe and pants, giving them to his mother and sister to wear. When they arrived home, his mother, the lady yaksha, saw Xu and cursed him furiously for not consulting her before he left. Xu apologized for his actions, explaining that there hadn’t been enough time for him to do so.\n\nThe servants, who were brought in to pay respects to the mistress of the house, were all trembling in terror. Biao persuaded his mother to learn their language, to wear clothes, and to appreciate choice foods, feeling gratified by her efforts. Mother and daughter dressed as men, in the fashion of the Manchus.\n\nAfter several months they were able to speak a little Chinese and Biao’s younger brother and sister gradually even became lighter-complected. The younger Xu brother was given the name Bao, while the daughter was named Ye’er, both proving to be powerfully strong. Biao disapproved of anyone being illiterate, so he taught his brother to read. Bao proved to be quite brilliant and had a thorough memory of classic history texts after reading them only once.\n\nHowever, he didn’t want to make a profession of being a scholar, so Biao taught him how to shoot with a long bow and how to ride a spirited horse. Bao proceeded to pass the imperial examination in martial arts. He married the daughter of a military officer.\n\nBecause she wasn’t entirely human, Ye’er wasn’t successful in attracting a husband. Biao’s subordinate, Yuan Shoubei, unexpectedly lost his wife, so Ye’er proved a sturdy replacement. She could draw an extremely heavy bow, hit a small bird at a distance of over a hundred paces, and never missed. Yuan always took her along on expeditions. In time he was appointed a high-ranking officer, and half of his outstanding contributions were due entirely to Ye’er.\n\nAt the age of thirty-four, Bao was also given a high military post. His mother always accompanied him on his expeditions, and whenever they encountered a large enemy force, she donned armor, grabbed a weapon, and aided her son in battle, causing the enemy to retreat at the sight of her. An imperial edict conferred upon her the title of “baron.” On behalf of his mother, Bao respectfully petitioned to see if she could have the title of “lady” conferred upon her instead. Later this request was accepted and thus she became a yaksha lady.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “It’s rare to hear about someone like the yaksha wife—except maybe it’s not so rare when you think about it carefully: there’s a lady yaksha in every family’s household.”",

It was always the case that although he didn’t know anything about their lives, he had certain suspicions about them.\n\nOne visitor told him, “In a few days, I’m going to be moving someplace near you.” When four or five days had passed, the visitor spoke with him again: “Today I’m leaving this village, and by tomorrow night you’ll thank me for that information.”\n\n“Where are you moving to?” the Changshan fellow asked him. The visitor didn’t provide any details, but simply pointed with his hand to the north. He dropped by later on at various points that day. Some of the time he asked to borrow utensils from people; however, if they were stingy and refused to loan them, he just disappeared.\n\nThe neighbors began to suspect that he was a fox. North of their village there were some ancient grave mounds that had caved in and couldn’t be surveyed for building upon, so the villagers thought that this must surely be his intended “residence.” The neighbors all grabbed some weapons and staves and went there.\n\nThey hid and listened, and for a long time there wasn’t anything the least bit strange happening. At nearly two o’clock in the morning, from inside the hole in the ground, the villagers heard the sounds of things being put away, as though there were thousands of persons talking and doing things. The group outside remained quiet and didn’t move.\n\nSuddenly they spotted some little people about a _chi_ tall. They were coming out one after another, and once they were outside it was clear that there couldn’t be very many of them. The villagers rose up with a clamor and attacked them as a group.\n\nOnce they began beating them all furiously, in the twinkling of an eye the little people simply disappeared.

Their manner of clothing, speech, and looks was not at all like that of the Chinese.\n\nOne of them commented, “Everywhere you go on a volcanic mountain, the smoke rises up as though from a kitchen’s cooking fires. Anywhere you walk, it’s like going out after a rain—you have to focus on stepping lightly; if by accident you kick up one of the mountain’s stones, you can accidentally stir flames into a roaring blaze.\n\n“On the other hand, if you pass through Flowing Sands River, with its crystal mountain, where cliffs stretch upwards into the sky while the sparkling river flows on all sides, it’s like there are no boundaries to limit it. In addition, there’s a narrow pass capable of accommodating only a single carriage; two dragons are stationed there to guard the route. To pass them, you must first pay your respects to them; once your obeisance to the dragons is accepted, the entrance to the pass will be opened. The dragons are white, their every scale and their manes shining brilliantly.”\n\nThe other monk replied, “We’ve been following this road for eighteen years. Twelve of us left the west, but only we two have survived to arrive in China. The teachings from the west must be passed along to four famous Chinese mountains: Mt. Tai, Mt. Hua, Mt. Wutai, and Mt. Laoga. Throughout the land they’ll spread the golden wisdom of Guanyin and of the bodhisattva Manjusri. If we can arrive at these destinations, we’ll live eternally with the memory of the Buddha.”\n\nListening to this description is likely to make people in the west yearn to know more about the east, just as people in the east yearn to learn more about the west. If sightseers coming from the east could just meet the monks halfway, each could exchange stories with the other—and surely that would be cause for hearty laughter, since both sides could then be excused from having to make the entire journey.",

        "body": "Xing De, from Zezhou, was a hero who lived like an outlaw in the forest. He possessed such strength that he could draw a quick-firing crossbow with nothing but his hands in order to shoot his arrows, a unique skill for which he was widely praised. But all his life, he never seemed able to make a success of himself, and whenever he left the forest, he always managed to squander whatever money he did earn.\n\nInfluential merchants operating between Nanjing and Beijing often hired Xing to ensure that they had nothing to fear while they were out on the road. At the beginning of one winter, there were two or three merchants who had paid Xing a very modest fee to come along with them on their trade route; once again, Xing used up everything in his purse just as they were about to purchase the goods they would transport to sell.\n\nThey met a man who was skilled at fortune-telling, so they consulted him. “This specific trigram is ‘regret,’” the fortune-teller told them, “and if you conduct this present business, you’re certain to lose all your investment.” Xing wasn’t at all pleased by this and wanted them to postpone their venture, but the merchants strongly insisted that they hurry along.\n\nAs the fortune-teller had predicted, when they arrived at the capital, all their goods were seized. By the middle of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, they were allowed to take dry goods out of the city. But the realization that they had no resources to reinvest quickly increased their depression.\n\nThat morning there was a light rain falling, so Xing hurried down the road to look for temporary lodging at an inn where he could rest and get something to drink. He noticed a gray-haired old man together with two young men drinking wine beneath a window. A servant boy with messy, unhealthy-looking hair was waiting on them.\n\nXing took a seat across the way from them, prompting a response from the old man. He indicated for the boy servant to bring Xing a cup of wine, but in doing so the boy accidentally dropped it, causing it to break into several pieces and spill onto the old man’s clothes. Infuriated, the young men stood up and grabbed him by the ears. The boy carried in a towel to wipe off the old man.\n\nThen Xing observed that there were half-inch thick iron arrows ringing each of the boy’s fingers and thumbs; each of the iron rings must have weighed more than two _liang_. When they’d finished eating, the old man told one of the young men to reach into his leather bag, take out the money inside it and stack it up on the table, then he called for some scales to measure it—and in the time it took to drink several cups of wine, they had the whole amount tallied up.\n\nThe young men then pulled a decrepit black mule over and helped the old man mount it; the boy servant also climbed on, and the young men followed after them as they departed through the gate. Each of the two young men, carrying bow and arrows at his waist, rounded up a horse and also rode out.\n\nFrom the corner of his eye, Xing stared at all that money departing and was consumed by greed the way a fire consumes fuel. He stopped drinking and hastily prepared to leave. He saw the old man steadying the boy as they rode off slowly at first, then as they left by the main road to take a shortcut, with the old man in front pulling tight on the reins, Xing drew back his bow, intercepting them, and they faced each other menacingly.\n\nThe old man bent down to take off his left boot and said with a laugh, “Have you forgotten the drink we gave you, greedy fellow?”\n\nXing had had enough, so he drew an arrow and shot it at him. The old man lay on his back over the saddle, stretched out his left leg, opened two toes like a pair of tongs and squeezed them together, catching the arrow. Laughing, he called out, “If I can stop this, what can you possibly do to me?”\n\nFurious, Xing called upon his unique skill, unerringly firing one arrow with another following immediately after it. The old man caught the first of them in his hand so he wasn’t defending himself against the second, fired so rapidly after it; as that second one flew right into his open jaw, he stumbled and fell, unconscious, the arrow stuck in his mouth. The boy servant also fell down. Overjoyed, Xing figured him dead and rode over to the body.\n\nThe old man spit out the arrow and leapt up, clapping his hands and declaring, “If this is just our first encounter, what kind of mischief are you going to cause next?” Xing was terrified, and his horse, equally startled, galloped away. He knew there was something very strange about the old man, so he didn’t dare turn back.\n\nHe covered thirty or forty _li_, till he came across a high official’s servants, who were heading to the capital with baggage and other freight; wishing to seize it since he valued it at a thousand pieces of gold, a covetous impulse took hold of Xing. He quickly pursued the group and soon heard the sound of other hoofbeats; turning his head, Xing saw the boy servant easily catching up with them on the decrepit mule, which was running so fast it was nearly flying. The boy shouted at him, “Don’t do it! If you try to seize the goods, I’ll have to make things difficult for you.”\n\nXing yelled, “Aren’t you aware that ‘there’s a certain Xing who can fire endless rounds of his short arrows’?”\n\n“A proper warning,” the boy replied. “Thanks for your words of wisdom.”\n\nXing took in the boy’s calm expression, which, despite his bow and arrows, was quite unconcerned. He fired three arrows, one after another without hesitation, like a flock of falcons soaring overhead. The boy didn’t treat this as anything unusual or extremely urgent, catching two of the arrows with his hands and the other with his mouth. Laughing, he taunted, “Such incredible skill, what a shame that it’s in the hands of an idiot! Since the old man was in a hurry, I didn’t have a chance to look at your bow; I also have something that’s not being used very practically, so see if you can send it back to me.”\n\nThen he took an iron ring off one of his fingers, flattened it out into an arrow, and gave it such a powerful toss that it whistled in the wind. Xing instinctively lifted his bow; but as the arrow made from the iron ring touched his bowstring, the string snapped with a loud twang and his bow also split in two. Xing was completely stunned. Before he could even see it to avoid it, the arrow had passed through his ear, and without his even being aware of it, it had fallen to the ground once it came out.\n\nThe boy rode over to take a closer look. Xing picked up his broken bow to try to beat him away. The boy took it away from him by force and stubbornly snapped it into pieces, then broke those pieces into smaller fragments and threw them down.\n\nWhen he was finished, he grabbed both of Xing’s arms with one hand, and with one foot he pressed down on Xing’s thighs; Xing’s arms felt like they’d been tied up, while his legs felt like they were being weighed down, and even summoning all of his strength, he couldn’t move a muscle.\n\nThere was a sash looped double around his waist that was about three fingers wide; using just one hand, the boy tied him up with it, and Xing, exhausted, gave up, like wood burned to ashes. The boy laid hold of Xing’s money, jumped onto his horse and waved his hand, calling out, “rash and impetuous,” then quickly rode away.\n\nXing returned home and until his death became a law-abiding person who always performed good deeds. He told everyone what had happened to him, without concealing any of the shameful details. In this he behaved like Liu Dongshan, and succeeded in becoming more like the Buddha.",

        "body": "Scholar Qiao lived in Jinning. While still young, he gained the reputation of being a talented person. By the time he turned twenty, however, he found himself still unsuccessful. Yet he possessed a heroic spirit. He had a scholar friend named Gu; when Gu died, Qiao offered timely support to his wife and children.\n\nThe county magistrate was quite impressed with his literary skill; when the magistrate died while serving out his post, his family members couldn’t afford to take his remains home, so Qiao spent all his resources and personally accompanied the magistrate’s coffin. The arduous journey there and back covered two thousand _li_. Other scholars admired Qiao all the more for this, yet his family suffered an even greater decline in fortune due to his actions.\n\nA certain Shi, who’d been a successful official in the provincial government, had a daughter named Liancheng who was skilled at embroidery and quite well read. Shi spoiled her with all the care he lavished on her.\n\nHe took out a piece of her embroidery called “Tired of Embroidering Pictures,” and invited young men to make it the subject of verse, so he could use the exercise to select a son-in-law. Qiao offered him a poem which began,\n\nHer hair sways loosely in dishabille,\n\nHaving come uncoiled during the night,\n\nThe morning’s orchid light shining through\n\nThe window onto embroidered lotus flowers,\n\nBut once her needle depicts a pair of loving fowls,\n\nShe moodily wishes to do no more,\n\nAnd for reasons that are unclear,\n\nCeases her needlework, knitting her brows.\n\nThen, in another, he praised the skill of her embroidery:\n\nWith her embroidery thread she imitates life,\n\nFilling cloth with flowers and birds drawn from nature;\n\nIn bygone times, it wasn’t the special skill\n\nIn the rendering of a silk picture,\n\nBut the fact that it contained a palindrome,\n\nThat moved a mighty ruler.\n\nLiancheng was quite pleased with the poems, and praised them to her father. Her father, however, disliked Qiao because of his poverty.\n\nSo whenever the girl ran into anyone, she always commended Qiao to them; she also sent an old woman, supposedly on her father’s orders, to give him some money so he could resume his studying. Qiao sighed gratefully, “Liancheng really understands me!” His mind turned to thoughts of her as a starving man latches onto thoughts of food.\n\nBefore long, however, Liancheng was betrothed to a salt merchant’s son named Wang Huacheng, so Qiao began to despair; yet still his spirit dreamt of her. Not long afterwards, Liancheng was struck down by consumption, the illness intensifying until she became bedridden.\n\nThere was a mendicant Buddhist monk from the west who claimed he could cure her—but he’d need a bit of flesh from a man’s chest to grind up in a mortar with other medicinal ingredients. Shi sent a servant to Wang’s household to report this to his intended son-in-law.\n\nWang guffawed and exclaimed, “The crazy old man wants me to cut off the flesh from over my heart!” He sent the servant back to Shi.\n\nShi then had the announcement spread that “Anyone who sacrifices the necessary flesh may marry her.” Qiao heard this and rushed over to the Shi home, took out a sharp sword and sliced the flesh from his chest as the monk had directed. Blood soaked his robe and trousers until the monk applied some medicine to the wound, and then the bleeding soon ceased.\n\nThe monk used his medical concoction to make three pills. After Liancheng was given one pill daily for three days, her illness vanished. Just as Shi was about to deliver on his promise, he decided to inform Wang first. Wang was incensed and intended to take Shi to court.\n\nShi then invited Wang to a feast, laying out a thousand taels on the table and declaring, “In gratitude for all I owe you, please accept this recompense.” Shi then explained his rationale for having violated their agreement.\n\n“It wasn’t that I cared too much for my own flesh,” Wang angrily replied, “but merely that I wanted to be sure my action would be adequately acknowledged. If I were to accept the money, I’d be selling my own flesh!” He shook his sleeves angrily and went home.\n\nLiancheng heard this and in her kindheartedness couldn’t bear for him to be so upset, so she sent the old woman to go console him and express her sentiments. In addition, she told her to say, “You’re a man of literary talent, so you won’t be in a low position for long. Why act like there are no other beauties in the world for you? My dreams have been most inauspicious, and I’m certain I’ll be dead in three years, so there’s no point in you fighting with someone over me since I’ll be going to the underworld soon enough.”\n\nWang told the old woman, “‘A gentleman is ready to die for his good friends,’ but not just for sexual allure. My honest concern was that Liancheng didn’t really understand me; but if she does, then even if we can’t live together for long, why would that bother me?” The old woman delivered Liancheng’s self-effacing vows of affection.\n\n“If that’s really the case,” Wang replied, “the next time we run into each other, she should smile at me, and then I could die without regret!” The old woman left and several days later when Wang was out, he met Liancheng as she was returning home from visiting her uncle, so he watched her carefully.\n\nWhen the girl turned her clear, bright eyes to look at him, she smiled graciously. Overjoyed, Wang exclaimed, “Liancheng really understands what kind of person I am!” The Wang family gathered and came to discuss the date for the wedding. Liancheng’s former illness returned, and after suffering for several months she finally found refuge in death. Qiao arrived to mourn her, but the pain of her loss was so great that he collapsed and died, too. Shi arranged to have his body sent home.\n\nQiao could tell that he was already dead, but he couldn’t find any place to rest. He walked outside and left his village, still hoping to see Liancheng. Off in the distance on a road running north and south, pedestrians were walking along like a procession of ants, so he slipped into line just like he was one of them.\n\nPresently, he entered a government office where scholar Gu, who was on duty there, asked him in amazement, “What’re you doing here?” He grasped Qiao’s arm at once and was about to guide him back home.\n\nQiao sighed deeply and said, “My worries haven’t been settled yet.”\n\n“I’m in charge of records and documents here, quite favored by the higher officials,” Gu told him. “If I can be of any service to you, I won’t hesitate to help.” Qiao asked him about Liancheng.\n\nGu then led him around many places, till they spotted Liancheng with a girl in white clothing, both wearing worried looks, with tears in their eyes, sitting in the corner of a veranda. When she saw Qiao appear, she sprang up as though overjoyed and briefly asked him how he had come there. “When you died,” Qiao explained, “I couldn’t bear to go on living!”\n\nLiancheng wept as she replied, “Though I was such an ungrateful person, you didn’t reject me—but why did you also die for me? I can’t give myself to you in this life, but I swear I’ll do so in the next one.”\n\nQiao told Gu, “You have business to take care of, while I’m content to be dead, and have no wish to live again. However, if I may trouble you to determine where Liancheng will be reincarnated, I can go there with her when she leaves.” Gu promised to do so and left.\n\nThe girl in the white clothing asked who Qiao was, so Liancheng explained everything from the beginning. As she listened, the girl seemed overwhelmed by sorrow. Liancheng told Qiao, “She has the same last name I have and she’s called Binniang, the daughter of Master Shi, the prefect of Changsha. We traveled the same road together to get here and became very close along the way.” As Qiao observed her, he found the girl quite admirable in demeanor.\n\nHe wanted to inquire further but Gu had already returned and congratulated Qiao, “I’ve been able to settle everything, so now why don’t you take this young lady with you as you return to life?” The two were extremely happy.\n\nThen just as they were about to say farewell and leave, Binniang burst into tears, crying, “Elder sister, if you leave, how will I get home? I beg you, have pity and help me, and I’ll work like a servant for you.” Liancheng was grief-stricken by her words and didn’t know what to do, so she turned to Qiao for advice.\n\nHe appealed to Gu again. This, however, was too difficult a problem for Gu to solve and he confirmed repeatedly that it just couldn’t be done. Qiao remained adamant in his pleading. Finally, Gu declared, “I’ll try to see if anything can be done.” He was gone for just a short time before he returned, shaking his hands negatively and exclaiming, “I told you so! There’s absolutely nothing more I can do!”\n\nWhen Binniang heard this, she began weeping pitifully and desperately grabbed onto Liancheng’s elbow, afraid she was going to leave without her. Heartbroken, and with no options, they stood silently facing each other; seeing the forlorn look on Binniang’s face was enough to make one grieve for her from the bottom of one’s heart. Testily, Scholar Gu said, “Oh, just take Binniang with you. If there are any repercussions, I’ll risk my life to cover for you!” Binniang immediately brightened and followed Qiao outside.\n\nQiao expressed his worry that the way was too far for her to travel. Binniang replied, “I’ll follow you—I don’t want to return home.”\n\n“That’s silly,” Qiao declared. “If you don’t go home, how can you return to life? Someday I’ll come to Hunan, and I’ll consider it my good fortune if you don’t run away from me.” It just so happened that two old ladies came by with documents for traveling to Changsha, so once Qiao placed the girl in their care, Binniang bid them a tearful farewell and left.\n\nAlong the way, Liancheng’s walking became slowed by weakness and after only a _li_ she had to stop for a rest; they had to stop over ten more times before they saw their village gate. Liancheng said, “Once we’re reborn, there may be some unexpected difficulties. Please ask for my bones to be brought to your home so if I return to life there, there’ll be no more trouble later.” Qiao agreed to do so.\n\nThen they headed for his house. Since Liancheng was so apprehensive that it was like she couldn’t take a step forward, Qiao stood for a long while, waiting for her. Then Liancheng said, “I’ve made it this far, but my four limbs are trembling so, it’s like I can’t control them. I’m afraid our hopes will be dashed, yet we should continue trying to carry out our plans carefully; otherwise, how can we live our lives freely once we’re reincarnated?”\n\nThey entered a side room together. After remaining silent for a few moments, Liancheng smiled as she asked, “Do you detest me?” Startled, Qiao asked what she was talking about. She replied, blushing, “I’m afraid our plans won’t work out and I’ll turn my back on you again. Before that happens, let me use this ghostly form to reward you.” This thrilled Qiao, and they joyously made love together. Since they were already hesitant and didn’t wish to rush into their new incarnations, they tarried in the side room for three days.\n\nLiancheng told Qiao, “There’s a proverb that says, ‘In the end, even an ugly wife has to face her husband’s parents.’ Simply sitting here fretting is no kind of long-range plan.” Then she urged Qiao to go on and return to life.\n\nWhen he came to where a coffin was sitting, his body immediately revived inside it. His family members were astounded and proceeded to help him take some soup. Qiao then sent servants to bring Shi to him and begged him to have Liancheng’s corpse brought there, claiming he could bring her back to life.\n\nShi was overjoyed to hear this and followed Qiao’s instructions. When her body was carried into the room, they witnessed her suddenly return to consciousness. She told Shi, “I’ve already given myself to Master Qiao, so there’s no reason for me to return home. If anything happens to challenge that, I’ll die just like before!” Shi went home, leaving behind a maid to serve his daughter.\n\nWang heard about this and submitted a court document seeking to have Liancheng returned to him. A government official accepted a bribe from him, and a judge was pressured to rule in Wang’s favor. Qiao, so distressed that he wanted to die, just didn’t know what to do.\n\nOnce Liancheng arrived at Wang’s house, she was so furious that she wouldn’t drink or eat and asked for nothing more than a speedy death. Once she was alone in her room, she used her sash to try to hang herself from a beam. By the next day, utterly exhausted, she was on the verge of dying. Frightened, Wang sent her back home to Shi. He in turn had her carried to Qiao. Wang learned of this but there was nothing to do about it, so he let it drop.\n\nWhen Liancheng was able to get out of bed, her thoughts turned continually to Binniang, and she wanted to send someone to bring word of what had become of her, but it was a long distance and a difficult journey to make.\n\nOne day, one of the servants came in to report, “There’s a horse and carriage at the gate.” Husband and wife went out to see, and there was Binniang waiting for them in the courtyard. Their greetings were filled with tears and laughter.\n\nBinniang’s father, the prefect, had escorted his daughter, so Qiao invited him to join them inside. “My daughter’s revival is thanks to you,” the prefect said, “and she’s sworn to marry no one but you, so I’m honoring her decision.” Qiao performed a ritual kowtowing to express his thanks. Official Shi also came, and the two fathers happily discussed their families.\n\nScholar Qiao’s birth name was Nian, and he was known as Danian.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “To pledge oneself to another on the basis of nothing but a smile might seem pretty foolish to most people: but if that’s foolish, then the deaths of Tian Heng’s five hundred men would have to be the most foolish thing of all! Recognizing his rare value and virtuous example, those warriors felt moved and couldn’t stop themselves from wanting to join him. So considering the infinite variety of our world, for a gifted young man to devote his splendid talents to nothing more than the smile of a beautiful woman would really be admirable!”",

        "body": "Scholar Huo and Scholar Yan of Wendeng were playmates when they were little and continued playing tricks on each other as they grew up. Neither wanted to be outdone by the other in their practical jokes. There was an old woman living near Huo who had helped Yan’s wife when she gave birth. She confided to Huo’s wife that Yan’s wife had genital warts. Huo’s wife passed this information on to her husband.\n\nWith some accomplices, Huo carried out a practical joke, watching until Yan was about to pass by and then claiming in conspiratorial tones, “I’ve been very intimate with a certain married woman.” The others acted like they didn’t believe him. Huo then made up a whole story from beginning to end, adding, “And to prove I’m telling the truth, there’s a pair of warts on her privates.”\n\nYan stopped just outside Huo’s window, listened to the whole conversation and then immediately rushed off without going inside. When he got home, he tried to force a confession out of his wife; though she was severely beaten, she refused to give in. Unable to bear Yan’s cruelty, she committed suicide.\n\nHuo regretted what he had done, but he also couldn’t bear to confess to Yan that he’d lied about the affair.\n\nFollowing the death of Yan’s wife, her ghost began rousing and unsettling his household by crying at night. Not long afterwards, Yan died abruptly, and the ghost stopped crying. Huo’s wife dreamed of a woman who shrieked at her, “I died in great torment, so how can you live so happily as a couple!” Once she woke up, she fell sick and after several days, she, too, died.\n\nHuo also dreamed of a woman pointing at him and cursing him, who then slapped his mouth. Startled awake, he could feel a dull pain in his lips—which proved puffy when he touched them—followed by a lingering illness. He didn’t dare yell or laugh, for if he opened his lips suddenly, the pain was unbearably excruciating.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “If one becomes a ghost after death, one must suffer severely unfair treatment despite feeling innocent. And private sores appearing on one’s lips is something like a kind of divine practical joke.”\n\nIn our town, a man named Wang used to pull pranks on a certain schoolmate of his. One time when the man’s wife was riding home to visit her parents and Wang found out that her donkey was easily spooked, he first hid himself in a thicket nearby, waiting for the woman to ride by, and then suddenly jumped out; the donkey was so frightened that the woman fell off it, and the boy who was accompanying her was too small to help her get back on.\n\nWang then solicitously held her as she remounted, taking full advantage of her vulnerability and of the fact that she didn’t know who he was.\n\nLater on, Wang was extremely proud of this and claimed that while the boy had been chasing the donkey, he’d taken the woman into the thicket and made love to her, proving himself to have been intimate with her by his descriptions of her underwear, pants, and shoes. When her husband heard this, he ran off in great shame.\n\nAfter a little while, Wang was looking through a gap in his window when he saw his old schoolmate holding a blade in one hand and shoving his wife along with the other, angry as hell.\n\nTerrified, Wang climbed over his wall and fled. The schoolmate followed, chasing him for two or three _li_ without success before turning back. Wang gave it everything he could to get away, placing his lungs under such stress that he developed a severe shortness of breath that lasted for several years before he recovered.",

        "body": "Wang Shixiu lived in Luzhou. Firm and strong, he was possessed of great might and could lift the kind of stone mortar that was used when washing rice. He and his father were also skilled at kicking the ancient-style football. When his father was just over forty, he drowned while crossing the Qiantang River.\n\nEight or nine years had passed when Wang traveled to Hunan for a visit and anchored his boat for the night on Dongting Lake. Since it was the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, with the moon rising in the east, the waters of the lake were as smooth as silk.\n\nAfter Wang had been gazing into the waters in the distance for some time, suddenly five men rose up from out of the lake, carrying a large carpet, which they spread out on the surface of the water for what seemed to be about half a _mu_. They brought out many fine wines and delicacies, and when their tile banquet utensils touched each other, they made an unusual sound.\n\nAt that moment, three of the men sat down on the carpet while the other two served them. One of the seated men wore yellow clothing, while the others’ clothes were white; both of them wore black kerchiefs on their heads, looking majestic, while their necks and backs were joined together, a most extraordinary being—but because the moonlight was hazy, Wang couldn’t see them all that clearly. The serving men were dressed entirely in brown; one was a boy and the other seemed to be an old man.\n\nThen Wang heard the one in yellow remark, “The moonlight’s quite beautiful tonight, and we’ve plenty of food and wine to enjoy.”\n\nOne fellow in white replied, “The spread here tonight is as grand and vast as the sea god’s banquet on Pear Blossom Island.” The three kept encouraging each other to compete in drinking bouts, filling up each other’s cups. But their words were too soft and soon Wang couldn’t hear them. The men in other boats just sat there quietly, afraid to move or breathe.\n\nWang carefully watched the servants, noticing that the old man looked like his father; but when he listened to his words, they sure didn’t sound like his father. It was almost the second watch at night. Suddenly one man said, “While the moon’s so bright, we should kick around a ball for fun.”\n\nThen he watched the boy sink into the water and emerge carrying a ball so large that it filled his arms, its quicksilver core making it shine brightly inside and out. The seated men all stood up. The man in yellow called for the old man to kick the ball together with him. It was booted more than a _zhang_ up into the air, its shine so brilliant that it dazzled observers’ eyes.\n\nInstantly and loudly it rebounded far away and sailed through the air to land in Wang’s boat. Wang was itching to show off his kicking skill, so wasting no time he stepped out with the ball, feeling extraordinarily light and buoyant. His vigorous impact with the ball almost split it, sending it a _zhang_ up into the air.\n\nLightning shot out from the rainbow-hued ball as it hurtled like a comet through the heavens and then plummeted straight into the lake, its waters bubbling and churning with a gurgling sound before finally calming. Meanwhile, the angry banqueters demanded, “How dare that stranger spoil our fun!”\n\nThe old man laughed and said, “Don’t be upset, please, that’s just the way we play ball in my family.” One of the white-clothed men took offense at his playful tone and angrily demanded, “We’re already angry, you old fart, so why’re you making light of it? You and the kid go catch that maniac, or we’ll be kicking your ass!”\n\nWang figured there was no place to run to, but he wasn’t afraid, so he stayed put in the boat. Suddenly he saw the boy and the old man holding weapons and coming his way. Wang watched attentively and when he realized that the old man really was his father, he cried, “Father! I’m over here.”\n\nThe old man was utterly astonished and the two stared at each other in mutual sadness. The boy meanwhile turned around and left.\n\n“Son, you’d better hide as quickly as possible,” the old man said. “Otherwise, we’ll all be killed!” As soon as he’d finished speaking, three men suddenly climbed up into the boat. With pitch black faces and eyeballs as large as pomegranates, they seized the old man and started to leave.\n\nWang used his strength to snatch his father back, and the boat began rocking so much that it snapped its anchor line. Wang then took a sword and cut off an arm from the man in yellow, who subsequently turned away. The men in white rushed at Wang; Wang clove the men’s skulls, so they fell into the water, thrashing loudly, and then sank from sight.\n\nAs they were planning how to cross the lake in the darkness, suddenly a huge, darkly gaping mouth broke the surface of the water. From all sides the waters poured into it with a roaring sound. Instantly there was a gush of water from the mouth, spraying skyward, tossing the boats everywhere on the lake. The lake people were terrified. There were two drum-shaped stone blocks on Wang’s boat, each weighing a hundred _jin_. Wang picked one up and tossed it in, violently stirring up the waters with a thunderous splash, then the waves gradually calmed; after he tossed in the other one, the stormy waters became completely still.\n\nWang feared that his father must be a ghost. But the old man explained, “I didn’t die. Nineteen men drowned in the river that time, each of them eaten by an evil monster; I just gave it a thumping kick like it was just a big ball. The evil creature offended its master in the Qiantang River, then it escaped to Dongting Lake. The three men are fish spirits, and what I kicked was a giant fish’s air bladder.”\n\nJoyously reunited, father and son put their oars into the water and paddled off. At daybreak, they saw that there was a large fish fin in the boat, about four or five _chi_ across, and they realized it was the arm that had been chopped off the night before.",

        "title": "Shang Sanguan",
        "body": "There was a scholar named Shang Shiyu, who lived in the ancient city of Zhuge. When he was drunk once, he playfully taunted the local despot. The man commanded his servants to attack Shang without warning. Shang had to be carried home, and subsequently died. He had two sons, the elder named Chen, and the younger named Li.\n\nShang’s daughter was named Sanguan. She was sixteen years old that year, and a date for her wedding had been set, but because of her father’s death, her marriage was postponed. Her elder brothers pursued litigation against the despot, but by the end of the year, nothing had been settled. The family of Sanguan’s fiancé sent someone to consult with her mother, to ask if as a matter of expediency, they might be allowed to conclude the wedding business.\n\nThe mother was on the verge of consenting. Then Sanguan came forward and declared, “My father’s body here isn’t even cold yet, and they want me to carry out a wedding ceremony? Is their son an orphan, without father or mother?” When her fiancé’s family heard this, they were ashamed and ceased negotiations.\n\nSoon the two brothers’ court case ruled against them, and they went home knowing that they’d been wronged. Their whole family felt mournful and frustrated. The brothers planned to delay burial of their father’s body in order to pursue further litigation.\n\nSanguan told them, “A person’s been murdered and the court pays no attention, so we know how this business will turn out. Do you think heaven’s going to have the Hell King reincarnate a Magistrate Bao for you two? It’s unbearable to think of father’s rotting remains and his coffin exposed to the air.” The two brothers paid heed to her words and buried their father.\n\nThe same night that their father was finally buried, Sanguan ran away without anyone knowing where she’d gone. Her mother felt shamed, and fearing that her intended son-in-law’s family would find out about this, she didn’t dare tell her relatives and instead sent her two sons to search everywhere for her. After almost half a year of looking, they couldn’t find her.\n\nWhen the despot’s birthday arrived, he brought together a variety of talented individuals to entertain him. One was an actor named Sun Chun, whose two apprentices came along to take part. One of them, Wang Cheng, was rather plain looking but had a clear singing voice that audiences admired very much. The other, Li Yu, had facial features as delicate and pretty as an attractive woman’s.\n\nThose attending the party called on Li to sing a song, but he declined, explaining he wasn’t any good at singing; when they insisted, he sang a few children’s tunes and country ditties, and once he finished, the audience applauded him.\n\nSun was embarrassed, and told his despot host, “Li hasn’t been my student for very long, so his duty tonight is only to serve wine to your guests. I hope you haven’t been offended.” Then he ordered Li to pour some wine. Li fetched the wine and offered it respectfully, keeping an eye on the despot to respond attentively to him. This delighted the despot.\n\nLater, once the guests had left, the despot asked Li to stay for the night. Li obediently prepared the despot’s bed and took off his host’s shoes, solicitously attending to him. With drunken words of seduction, the despot started fondling him, but Li simply smiled and accepted his advances. The despot became even more intrigued with him and dismissed his servants so he could be alone with Li. Taking charge after the servants left, Li closed and bolted the door.\n\nAll of the servants had gone to another room to have a drink. After some time, they heard a creaking sound coming from their master’s room. One of the servants went to check on it, finding the hallway completely dark and silent. Just as he was about to turn back around, there was suddenly a very sharp sound from inside as though something heavy had been hanging and then the rope suspending it had snapped. The servant called out, asking what was happening, but there was no answer.\n\nHe called for the others to help him break in and when they did, they found that the despot’s head had been severed from his body; Li was also dead and there was a broken rope on the floor, one end tied around the roof beam, the other around Li’s neck. The servants, horrified, conveyed the news of this to the despot’s family, and as the whole household assembled, no one could explain what had happened.\n\nThey moved Li’s body into the hall of the house and in doing so they noticed that his shoes and stockings felt empty, like there were no feet in them; when they took them off, they found another pair of white mourning slippers over bound feet, meaning that Li was a woman. They were even more shocked.\n\nThey summoned Sun Chun and grilled him about Li. He was pale with astonishment and had no idea what to say. Finally he told them, “A month ago, Li came and asked to be my apprentice, saying he wanted to help celebrate your master’s birthday, but I honestly never knew who he was.” Since the girl was wearing mourning clothes, they suspected that she was an assassin hired by the Shang family.\n\nFor the time being, they stationed two men to guard the body. The girl looked like she was still alive; when they touched her, her body felt warm and soft. The two men privately conspired to have their way with her.\n\nOne of them embraced her corpse, turning it over, and was just starting to take off her clothes when suddenly it was like something had smashed his head, as blood poured violently from his mouth and he died in moments. His fellow guard was terrified and yelled for the servants. They subsequently treated Li’s body like it was a deity’s.\n\nIn addition, the local prefecture was informed of the matter. A prefectural magistrate asked the Shang brothers about the matter, and they replied, “We don’t know what happened. But our sister ran away six months ago.” When they were sent to take a look at Li’s corpse, they confirmed that it was Sanguan. The magistrate marveled at this, ruled that the two brothers should receive Sanguan’s body for burial, and also decreed that the despot’s family must not pursue revenge against the Shangs.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The Shang family had a female assassin in it and didn’t realize it, so one can imagine how manly her two brothers must have been. Concerning Sanguan’s behavior, in shame for being unable to match her, the Xiao River itself—let alone mortal men—would stop flowing! I hope that every woman will sew a silk figure of this Sanguan, for her deed should be valued no less than what might have been performed by a hero like Guan Yu.”",

Yu was then sixteen and when he found nothing but his father’s shoes, he was so grief-stricken and angry that he wanted to die.\n\nThat night, he waited till his mother was asleep, quietly grabbed an iron hammer and went out to the field where his father had been lying, hoping to avenge his father by killing the attacker.\n\nIn a little while, a wolf arrived, hesitantly sniffing around. Yu Jiang didn’t move. A moment later, the wolf’s tail brushed against his forehead, then it gradually lowered its head and licked his leg. Yu still remained motionless. The wolf happily approached, eager to tear into Yu’s neck. Yu Jiang quickly used the hammer to beat out the wolf’s brains, killing it where it stood. He got up and pulled the wolf over into the tall grass.\n\nNot long afterwards, another wolf showed up, and did the same thing as the first one. Yu killed it, too. Until about midnight, no other wolves came along. Just then as he dozed off, he dreamt that his father said to him, “By killing two of the beasts, you’ve vented my hatred. But the one that killed me had a white nose; it wasn’t either of these.”\n\nYu Jiang then woke up and remained laying there in wait. It began to get light, and the other wolf still hadn’t come. He wanted to drag the other wolves home, but was afraid of frightening his mother, so he tossed them together into a dry well and went home. When evening fell, he went out again, but there were still no more wolves. It went on like this for three or four nights.\n\nSuddenly one night a wolf appeared, bit down on Yu Jiang’s foot and started dragging him away. As it pulled him for several paces, his flesh was stabbed by thorns, his skin wounded by stones. Yu looked like he was dead. The wolf then pushed him over on the ground with the intention of tearing into his belly.\n\nYu Jiang quickly raised his hammer and brought it down on the wolf; as it fell to the ground, he connected with yet another blow, and then the beast was dead. He looked at it carefully, and indeed it had a white nose.\n\nRejoicing, he slung it over his back and went home, where he told his mother what had happened. Weeping, she followed him outside, where he took the two wolves out of the dry well.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Though this peasant family was of low social rank, how did it manage to produce such an excellent, brave boy?

        "body": "Zhao Wang and his wife, who lived in Teng county, were Buddhists, so they didn’t eat meat dishes and were regarded throughout the area as virtuous people. Zhao’s family was relatively affluent. They had a daughter named Xiao’er, who was uniquely intelligent and beautiful, and Zhao considered her a precious child. When she was six, Zhao sent her and her elder brother, Changchun, to a private school to study under a teacher for five years, and in that time she mastered the Five Confucian Classics.\n\nHer schoolmate, Ding Zimo, three years older than Xiao’er, proved an elegantly unconventional writer and became very attached to her. He privately confided his intentions to his mother, then went to Master Zhao to ask for his permission to marry Xiao’er. Zhao expected that his daughter could marry into a rich and influential family, so he wouldn’t permit it.\n\nSoon afterwards, Zhao was drawn in by the White Lotus Society; when Xu Hongru rebelled against the government, the entire Zhao family was implicated and its members regarded as criminals.\n\nXiao’er had read many books and was adept at comprehending new things, so she skillfully mastered the sect’s magic tricks, such as cutting out paper men who then became soldiers, and gathering beans that were then turned into horses. Among the six girls who followed Xu’s instruction, she was the most accomplished one and hence she learned all of his skills. Due to his daughter, Zhao was appointed to a very important position within the sect.\n\nAt that time, Ding, who was eighteen, became a student at the Teng county academy, but refused to discuss the possibility of his getting married, or to forget Xiao’er. Finally, he ran off and joined Xu’s armed forces to be near her. Xiao’er was happy to see him and treated him with much greater respect than she normally gave to others.\n\nShe continued working with Xu and took charge in discussions of the war situation. She often came and went in the early morning or late at night, so her parents didn’t even have a chance to see her.\n\nDing saw Xiao’er each night and often ordered the servants to leave them while he discussed battles with her until the wee hours of the morning. Ding asked her confidentially, “Do you know the real reason I come here?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” she replied.\n\n“I had no intention of joining the struggle and receiving a high position,” Ding explained, “so the fact is that I came here for you. But this White Lotus sect is flawed, and it’ll finally be crushed. As clever as you are, don’t you realize this? If you’ll follow me and leave here, I’ll never betray you.”\n\nXiao’er briefly felt disheartened, but suddenly, as though startled awake from a dream, she said, “We can’t just arrange our marriage without notifying my parents—that would be immoral, so please, let’s tell them first.”\n\nThen the two went to explain to her parents the advantages and disadvantages of their options, but Xiao’er’s father couldn’t see the sense of it: “Since our teacher is like an immortal, how can the situation be in such chaos?” Xiao’er knew she couldn’t persuade her father to accept their decision, so she simply rolled up her loose hair into a coil like that worn by a married lady.\n\nThen she brought out a pair of hawks and assisted Ding as they each straddled one of them; swiftly the hawks spread their wings and the birds, like the fabled _jian_, joined wing to wing, and flew off. At dawn, they arrived at a field called Laiwu. With her fingers, Xiao’er touched the hawks at the nape of their necks and they immediately landed.\n\nShe then collected the two hawks together. Once she’d made a pair of donkeys from some paper, Ding and Xiao’er hurried off to a village on the north side of the mountain, where they found shelter from the chaos in their lives, renting a house and taking up residence there.\n\nBecause the two had hastily left their homes, they hadn’t packed any provisions and lacked the money to pay for their needs. Ding was very worried about their situation. They tried to turn to their neighbors to borrow supplies, but their neighbors were unwilling to loan them anything. Though Xiao’er didn’t let on that she was worried, she pawned her jade earrings.\n\nThey closed their door and sat quietly, competing with each other by guessing at riddles that were written on lanterns, recalled from the contents of books that they’d read before. The winner would join two fingers together and strike the loser on the wrist with them as a punishment.\n\nTheir neighbor to the west, named Weng, was a mighty outlaw. One day, he returned from his plundering with some loot. Xiao’er remarked to Ding, “They say ‘one is as rich as one’s neighbors,’ so what are we worried about? We could temporarily borrow a thousand taels from him!”\n\nDing thought it would be an awkward matter to bring up. Xiao’er replied, “I can make him glad to give us the money.” Then with scissors she cut out a paper figure in the shape of an underworld judge, placed it on the ground, and covered it with a chicken cage.\n\nAfter that she took Ding by the hand, sat him down on a bed, warmed some wine that was stored there, and took out the _Book of Rites_ to play a drinking game: each of them would pick a certain book number and a certain page in it, and then a certain person on that page, then they’d read over the page together. If the person selected had a name which contained the food, water, or wine radicals in its characters, the selector would have to take a penalty drink, and if the characters had two of the radicals in them, the drink penalty would be doubled.\n\nLater, when Xiao’er came across the name “Jiu Ren,” Ding took a large goblet, filled it to the brim, and encouraged her to drink it all. Xiao’er then congratulated him, saying, “When the loaned taels arrive, you have to drink the double portion.” Ding randomly opened the book and came across the expression “turtle man.”\n\nWith a big laugh, Xiao’er giggled, “Our business has been successful!” She poured out the wine and passed it to Ding. He resisted taking the penalty drink. “You’re an aquatic sign,” teased Xiao’er, “so you should be able to drink like a turtle.”\n\nAfter happily competing with each other, they heard a sound come from inside a basket they had. Xiao’er jumped up and said, “It’s here.” When they opened the basket, they found a cloth bag, inside which was a huge amount of gold, filling it almost to overflowing. Ding was overwhelmed with amazement and joy.\n\nLater, an old woman from the Weng household, holding a child in her arms, came to kill time by paying them a visit and confidentially remarked, “When the master first came home, he lit up a lantern and set it down. Suddenly the ground split violently, revealing a bottomless darkness.\n\n“An underworld judge then emerged from it and declared, ‘I am an official of the realm below. The immortals on Mt. Tai assembled all the underworld’s personages to put together a book listing the names of criminals. Not unless the criminals bring out a thousand silver lamps, each of which would have to be worth ten taels, will their crimes be canceled.’\n\n“Our master was terrified, so he burned incense, kowtowed and prayed, and respectfully offered the judge a thousand taels to enjoy. The judge then immediately reentered the abyss, and the earth closed up after him.”\n\nAs Ding and Xiao’er heard this, they pretended that they were astonished, too. Henceforth they gradually purchased some livestock, hired some male and female servants, and began to manage their enhanced estate.\n\nThe village troublemakers spied this affluence and banded together with other malcontents so they could climb over Ding’s wall and rob him. Ding and Xiao’er recognized this in their dreams and woke up to the sight of men holding torches in their room. Two men grabbed Ding; another man reached out his hand to squeeze Xiao’er’s breast.\n\nShe sat up, distracting him with the magical gestures of her fingers, as she breathily cried, “Stop, stop!” There were thirteen robbers and all of them suddenly stood dazed at this, their tongues hanging out, as senseless as trees.\n\nXiao’er put on her pants and shouted to all the household servants, and one by one they tied each bandit’s hands and arms behind his back, forcing each man to confess to his part in the evil deed. Then Xiao’er reproached them, exclaiming, “We’ve settled down here after coming from far away. You should try to befriend us. How can you behave so immorally like this? It’s natural that people sometimes experience an emergency; if you were in great difficulty, you could just tell us that plainly—and would we be stingy? You’ve behaved like cruel and evil people and you should be executed for what you’ve done; but I can’t bear to do so, so for now I’ll set you free and you can go, but if you try it again there’ll be no forgiveness!” All the robbers kowtowed their thanks and left.\n\nBefore long, Xu was captured, and Zhao’s family, from his wife to his sons, were all executed. Ding sent money to ransom the son of Xiao’er’s eldest brother and then brought him home. The boy was just three years old, and they raised him as their own son. They gave him the surname Ding and called him Changtiao. Over time, people in the village gradually came to realize that he was related to the White Lotus religious sect.\n\nAbout then, a plague of locusts attacked their crops. Xiao’er took several hundred of her kites and when she released them into the fields, the locusts kept their distance from them, avoiding their fields, and consequently the crops remained safe and sound.\n\nThe villagers were jealous of her abilities and the village men went to the local magistrate to claim that Ding and Xiao’er were actually the surviving confidants of the executed Xu. The magistrate looked enviously at the wealth and livestock that he might extort from Ding. Indeed, Ding had to pay the magistrate a heavy bribe and then he left the family alone.\n\n“Our wealth didn’t come from a just source,” Xiao’er observed, “so it’s reasonable that we lost some of it. However, there are vicious people in this village, and we can’t live here any longer.” So they sold their property cheaply and moved away, ending up in the western part of Yidu county.\n\nXiao’er was an ingenious person, and good at accumulating money; her ability at business was superior to any man’s. She once started a ceramic business, training each worker herself so they could all make chess pieces and lamps with such fabulous patterns that other shops couldn’t compete with them, hence their prices soared and they quickly sold out. Ding and Xiao’er lived there for several years, their exceptional fortunes making the family’s name an influential one.\n\nXiao’er supervised the several hundred female and male workers strictly, and they weren’t paid for doing nothing. When she had free time, she often made tea for Ding and played chess with him, or she’d happily read some historical accounts. The revenues came in and went out from the workers’ businesses, and every five days there’d be an examination session; Xiao’er would personally manage the testing after Ding checked their personnel records and called the roll. The couple frequently gave out rewards for good work, though lazy workers were whipped and punished through protracted kneeling.\n\nOn appointed days, the workers were given the night shift off while Xiao’er and Ding would set out delicacies and wine for them and call on the workers to sing folk songs to make them all laugh. Xiao’er was as sharp and discerning as a goddess, so no one ever dared try to pull anything over on her. Besides, since she often helped them with their work, the business as a result was easy to run. Since there were over two hundred families in the village, and since she brought in capital for the poor ones as well as for the others, the village didn’t just idle away its time without producing anything.\n\nThere was a considerable drought at the time, so Xiao’er directed the villagers to set their earthenware jars out in the open, then she rode out of the village to where she could use her magical arts to cause a heavy rain, and for five _li_ in all directions, everywhere was soaked. The people regarded her as an immortal. Xiao’er came out and never hid herself from them, so the villagers all got to see her.\n\nA certain group of young men, who lived together, privately thought her quite beautiful; however, whenever any of them encountered her, they would never dare look up, out of respect for her.\n\nEach autumn, if there were any boys in the village who were unable to farm, she gave them some money and asked them to pick edible thistle, and since they’d been doing this for twenty years, there had accumulated enough thistle to fill an entire house. People furtively ridiculed her for this practice.\n\nAbout that time, a great famine struck Shandong province, and people actually began to eat each other; Xiao’er then brought out all the thistles and mixed them with cereal grains to fend off the famine, so even the nearby villagers were able to rely entirely upon her provisions and didn’t have to abandon their homes to find food.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Xiao’-er’s extraordinary accomplishments were made possible by her innate talents, not solely by acquired knowledge and practice. For if there had been no suggestion to make her wake from her dream, she might have died already due to association with the White Lotus Society. From this one sees that the world often does contain people with this kind of talent, but even they can go in the wrong direction and die—and the number of such people will not be a small one. No one knew that among Xiao’er’s six classmates there was no one as extraordinary as she. And it’s a pity that more people didn’t get to meet a scholar such as Ding.”",

        "title": "Gengniang",
        "body": "Jin Dayong was the son of a long-established family in Zhongzhou. He was engaged to a prefect’s daughter named Gengniang, who was beautiful and virtuous. The happy couple were very sincerely devoted to each other.\n\nTo avoid the roving bandits who exploited the chaos at the collapse of the Ming, entire families ran away. Jin took his family and fled to the south. On the road, they met a young man named Wang Shiba, who identified himself as being from Guangling prefecture, who was also running away together with his wife, and was willing to be their guide. Jin was happy to hear it and they stopped their traveling to join him.\n\nWhen they arrived at the river, Gengniang secretly begged Jin, “Don’t get into the same boat with Wang. He keeps turning around to stare at me with an unnatural look, like he’s planning something insidious.” Jin agreed to do as she asked.\n\nWang solicitously went to search for a large boat and transported all of Jin’s belongings to it. Jin couldn’t bear to refuse him. He thought that since the young man had brought his own wife, there might not be any problem. Wang’s wife and Gengniang shared the same cabin.\n\nWhen Wang sat down at the front of the boat, he spoke to the boatman as though they knew each other quite well. Before long, the sun set as they traveled far from shore and the darkness became so complete that they couldn’t tell south from north. Jin looked around and sensed some hidden dangers, feeling quite suspicious.\n\nAn instant later, the moon rose so brightly that they could see all of the reeds around them. Once they had anchored the boat, Wang invited Jin and his father to go out with him on deck, then seized a fleeting chance to push Jin into the water. Jin’s elderly father saw what Wang did and wanted to scream. The boatman took his punt pole and struck him with it, then drowned him, too. Jin’s mother heard the sound and came out to check on it, so she was also struck and drowned.\n\nWang began to call for help. When her mother-inlaw first stepped out, Gengniang had been behind her, so she secretly witnessed what had happened. However, she was unafraid when she’d heard her family being drowned, and cried, “My in-laws have fallen overboard, now I have nowhere to go!”\n\nWang appeared and encouraged her, “Don’t worry, miss—please come with me to Jinling. My family’s farmhouse is quite sufficient to accommodate you and to ensure that no harm will befall you.”\n\nGengniang stopped weeping and accepted his offer, commenting, “If it’s really as you said, then my desire will be satisfied.” Wang was amazed and provided Gengniang decent food and drink. Just after sunset, he wanted to force Gengniang to make love with him. She explained that she was having her period just then, so Wang instead went to sleep with his wife.\n\nAs the first watch was nearly past, the couple began fighting noisily, but no one knew why. Yet they heard the wife say, “For everything you did, may a thunderbolt split your skull open!” Wang then beat her. The wife yelled, “Kill me then! I really don’t want to be the wife of a murdering thief!”\n\nWang shouted in anger, grabbed her and dragged her outside. Then they heard a splashing sound, and afterwards someone said that the wife had drowned.\n\nSoon afterwards they arrived at Jinling and Wang led Gengniang to his home, and as they entered the main hall, they saw Wang’s old mother. She was surprised because Wang’s wife wasn’t with them. “My wife fell into the water and died,” Wang explained, “so I’m marrying this lady.”\n\nWhen they came to the bedroom, Wang again wanted to make love. Gengniang laughed and said, “You’re a man of over thirty, so haven’t you had sex before? Even a poor man on the street will indulge in cups of low-grade wine on his wedding night; you’re from a rich household, so it shouldn’t be a problem to take care of this right away. How can it be properly conducted if we’re both sober?” Wang, delighted to hear this, prepared the wine so they could drink while sitting together.\n\nGengniang held up a wine goblet, encouraging Wang to drink more by acting solicitously and sincerely. Wang gradually became drunk and then declined to drink any more. Gengniang goaded him through flattery and strong persuasion to take up a large bowl of wine. Wang couldn’t bear to deny her, so he drank it, too. As a result, he became dead drunk, took off all his clothes, and urged Gengniang to sleep with him.\n\nGengiang removed all the utensils and candles, then excused herself by explaining that she needed to urinate; she went outside, found a knife, returned, and as she felt with her hand in the dark for Wang’s neck, he grabbed her arm and started mumbling about sex. Gengniang slashed at him with all her strength but didn’t kill him, so he howled in pain and jumped up; again she wounded him and he began bleeding to death.\n\nThe old woman heard some kind of noise and had hurried to ask what was going on, so Gengniang had to kill her, too. This awakened Wang’s younger brother, Shijiu. Gengniang knew she wouldn’t be exempted from punishment for her crime, so she anxiously tried to cut her own throat; the knife, however, was dull, so it wouldn’t penetrate. She opened the door and ran out. As Shijiu chased after her, she threw herself into a pond; and by the time he called for servants to help him rescue her, she was already dead, though she still looked as beautiful as when she was alive.\n\nWhen they all examined Wang’s corpse, they found a letter on the window sill and when they opened and read it, they found Gengniang’s account of all the injustices her family had suffered. They all felt that her actions had been entirely just, so they agreed to collect some money together to give her an honorable funeral.\n\nBy dawn, thousands of people had gathered; when they saw her appearance, every one of them paid their respects to her. In the course of the day, they collected a hundred taels, hence they were able to give her a burial south of the village. Some kind people dressed her in a pearled hat and robe, and buried her along with many other valuables.\n\nOriginally, when Jin had supposedly drowned, he actually kept afloat on a wooden plank, so he didn’t die. At about daybreak, he came to the Huai River, where a small boat rescued him. The boat had been built and sponsored by a wealthy resident named Yin, for the purpose of rescuing people who were drowning. When Jin regained consciousness, he expressed his gratitude to him.\n\nYin, who was a generous person, asked Jin to stay and tutor his son. Jin didn’t know what had become of his relatives and he was just about to go searching for them, so he couldn’t accept the offer. Yin immediately replied, “We just pulled the bodies of an old man and woman out of the river.”\n\nJin feared they might be his parents, so he hurried to see if it was true. He verified their identity, and Yin bought him their coffins. Seeing Jin overcome by grief, Yin added, “We also saved a young woman from drowning who said her husband was a man named Jin.” By the time the surprised Jin had wiped away his tears and hurried out, she had already arrived, though she didn’t look at all like Gengiang, and appeared to be the wife of Wang Shiba. She turned to face Jin, crying loudly, and begged him not to abandon her.\n\nJin replied, “My heart is already broken, so how could I even consider you?” The young woman became even more distraught. Yin questioned her carefully, happily concluding that she was heaven’s recompense for Jin’s loss, and persuaded him to accept her as his wife.\n\nJin then prepared to leave to begin his mourning, saying, “I was determined to seek revenge, so now I’m afraid to take on the additional responsibility of being someone’s husband.”\n\n“From your perspective,” the young woman remarked, “if you were to find that Gengniang still exists, could you give her up simply for the sake of vengeance?” Yin thought her words perfectly appropriate and suggested that he could temporarily take care of her instead of Jin, and Jin agreed to this.\n\nAfter Jin chose an auspicious burial site for his parents, the young woman put on mourning clothes and wept like she was mourning her own in-laws. Once they had been buried, Jin thought about whether to turn to the sword for revenge or to beg for alms, and was just about to leave for Guangling.\n\nThe young woman stopped him and said, “My maiden name is Tang and my grandparents live in Jinling, in the same hometown as that killer Wang. The place he named earlier, Guangling, he just made up. In addition, there are river bandits and half of them are his partners. You can’t get revenge on him without causing yourself great trouble.” Jin paced back and forth, not knowing what direction to take.\n\nSuddenly they heard the news that a woman had avenged herself on her enemies and the names were reported so clearly that Jin knew it was his wife, Gengniang. At first he was pleased to hear this, but then it only made him sadder, thinking about Gengniang’s sacrifice. He declined to marry the other woman, saying, “Fortunately, Gengniang wasn’t dishonored by him. My home had an extraordinary woman like her—how could I be disloyal to my love and marry again?” The young woman thought that their marriage had already been decided upon, so she wouldn’t agree to leave, insisting she’d gladly serve in his household as a concubine.\n\nThey met Yin’s old friend, Yuan, the vice-general of an army garrison, who was heading westward to the battlefront, and decided he’d stop to see Yin on the way; when he met Jin, he took an immediate liking to him and asked if he would agree to be his secretary. Soon afterwards, when the roving bandits began raiding again, General Yuan achieved great victories against them; Jin consulted with him on important matters and was rewarded because of this, with Yuan bestowing on him a higher position that carried an officer’s title, and he was then sent home.\n\nThe couple then decided to complete the rituals to formalize their marriage. After they’d been at home for several days, Jin decided to take Tang with him to visit Jinling, so they could pay their respects at Gengniang’s burial site. As they were crossing the Zhen River, they decided to walk up Mt. Jin.\n\nWhile they were in midstream, enjoying the boat ride, suddenly a small boat passed by in which there were an old woman and a young lady, the latter looking strangely like Gengniang. When the boat quickly passed by, she peered into the boat’s window at Jin, her expression looking even more like Gengniang’s. Surprised and bewildered, but not daring to question how it was possible, Jin called out, “Watching a flock of ducks, two of them fly above the heavens!”\n\nWhen the young lady heard this, she called back, “The greedy dog licks out the cat’s bowl!” This was their private code for some of the teasing they used to exchange in their bedroom during intimacy. Jin was stunned, and as they turned around for another approach, it became clear that this really was Gengniang.\n\nServants helped her into Jin’s boat, where the two embraced and wept while the other travelers were all moved by their emotional exchange. Tang deferred respectfully to Gengniang as Jin’s proper wife. Gengniang was surprised and asked about her, so Jin explained everything that had happened.\n\nGengniang took Tang’s hand and said, “I often recall the conversation we had while we were on the boat together, and could never have guessed that one day we’d become part of the same household. You properly took my place to bury our parents-in-law, and now it’s only right that I should first thank you for that—so how can you treat me as anything but family?” Then they worked out their age order and since Tang was a year younger, Gengniang referred to her as her younger sister.\n\nOriginally, after Gengniang had been buried, she didn’t realize that several seasons had passed. Suddenly someone called to her, “Gengniang, your husband isn’t dead, so the proper thing is for you to be reunited.” Then it was as though she had awakened from a dream. She reached out with her hands and felt walls on all sides of her, only then realizing that her body had died, and that she had already been buried. She felt trapped, though she wasn’t experiencing any pain.\n\nThere were some young thieves who’d spied on her being buried with lavish items, so eventually they opened up her grave and broke into her coffin. Just as they were about to search it, they saw that Gengniang was still alive—so they terrified each other. Gengniang, afraid that they’d harm her, pitifully exclaimed, “I’m so lucky that you came along to help me see the sun and sky again. There’s a jade hair clasp on my head that you can take when you leave. Besides, you could sell me to a Buddhist nun for some small amount of money. I also won’t report you.”\n\nThe young thieves kowtowed to her, saying, “You were willing to die to protect your chastity, so both gods and men admire you. We committed this immoral act because we’re so poor and have nothing to make things any better for us. But we’d consider ourselves fortunate if only you won’t report us—and how could we dare to send you off to a Buddhist nun!”\n\n“I’ll be happy to say nothing,” replied Gengniang.\n\nThe young thieves added, “There’s a Lady Geng of Zheng River, widowed and childless, and if she sees you, she’ll be very happy to take you in.” Gengniang thanked them. She took off her pearl-laden clothing, deciding to turn it over to the young thieves. The young men said they couldn’t possibly take it; but she insisted, so they respectfully accepted it.\n\nCarrying her things, they then went to Lady Geng’s home, explaining that Gengniang had lost her way because of the strong winds. Lady Geng had a large home, but lived alone there. When she saw Gengniang, she was overjoyed, thinking of her like she was her own daughter. It just so happened that Lady Geng and Gengniang were coming back by boat from visiting Mt. Jin at this time. Gengniang described to her everything that had happened.\n\nWhen Jin later came aboard their boat to pay his respects to Lady Geng, she treated him like he was her own son-in-law. She invited them all home and asked Jin to stay several days before they returned home. Afterwards they made visits back and forth, always staying in contact.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Before the great reversal, the wicked man survived while the virtuous man died. People hated the survivor but shed tears for the dead. As for talking and laughing fearlessly, killing one’s enemies, and providing a model of courage for the ages, there aren’t many who could match this devoted wife! Who’s to say that a woman can’t perform the same heroism as a man, as the proverb declares?”",

        "title": "Gong Mengbi",
        "body": "Liu Fanghua was a resident of Baoding. He was the wealthiest man in his village, generous and hospitable, and loved to make friends. If people were in need, he was anxious to help them, regardless of the expense. Every time guests and friends wanted to borrow money from him, he never refused them, and he never asked them to repay it. Only one guest, named Gong Mengbi, from Shanxi, never in his life begged or requested anything of him. Each time he visited, he would stay with Liu for a year. Because conversation with Gong was interesting and charming, Liu spent most of his time with him.\n\nLiu had a son named He, who began calling Gong his uncle when he was still a child. Gong also enjoyed playing with He. Whenever He returned home from school, Gong would pull up tiles from the floor and they buried pebbles under them, laughing as they pretended they were burying golden treasure. They did this in the five main rooms of the house, digging and hiding them almost everywhere. Other guests laughed at Gong’s childish behavior, but Gong never minded what they said about him, and Liu was so very fond of him that he felt closer to him than to anyone else.\n\nAs more than ten years passed, the family’s wealth gradually began to diminish till it could no longer support the many guests and their demands, and consequently the visitors became fewer and fewer over time; a group of some ten or so, however, continued to come to chat and drink through the night, as usual. In Liu’s old age, the family’s fortunes declined even further till they had to sell off their farmland for the funds to provide dishes for their guests. Liu He also squandered resources, following his father’s example to create a coterie of friends, and Liu didn’t interfere with his son’s spending.\n\nBefore long, Liu fell ill and died, but the family couldn’t even afford a coffin for him. Gong then took his own money to cover the burial expenses, and Liu He was very grateful for his kindness. He subsequently entrusted all of the family’s business, large and small, to “uncle” Gong. Whenever he came inside the house, Gong took ceramic shards and pebbles from his sleeve and tossed them into the corners of the rooms, though no one had any idea, even He himself, why he was doing so.\n\nOn a regular basis, He expressed his worries about the family’s poverty to Gong. “You have no idea about how to work your way out of your difficulties,” said Gong. “Don’t complain about being penniless; if someone gave you a thousand taels, you’d immediately spend every last bit of it. If a man relies on no one but himself, how can he be afflicted by being poor?”\n\nOne day, Gong took his leave of the family, explaining he wanted to return home. Weeping, He urged him to return soon, and after promising to do so, Gong then left. As his poverty increased without Gong’s help, He pawned everything he had until eventually there was nothing left. Daily he looked for Gong to return, mistakenly thinking he would come back to manage their affairs, but Gong had erased all evidence of his whereabouts, and no one knew where he was.\n\nYears earlier, when He was a newborn and the Liu family was very wealthy, Master Liu had negotiated the future marriage of his son into the Huang family of Wuji, a prominent family thanks to its wealth rather than to official appointments. After hearing of Liu Fanghua’s financial collapse, Huang privately regretted the arrangement. When Master Liu died, though an announcement of the news was delivered to the Huangs, no one represented them at Liu’s funeral service; the Lius accepted the bogus excuse that it was such a long way for the Huangs to travel.\n\nOnce He had completed his period of mourning, his mother sent him to visit his future in-laws to settle on a date for the wedding, hoping that the Huangs would show pity and take care of them when they saw his circumstances. When Master Huang heard that He had arrived in ragged clothing and worn-out shoes, he ordered the gatekeeper not to let him come in. Huang then sent him a message saying, “Go home, gather together two hundred taels, and if you do that, come back; otherwise, please consider our agreement no longer valid, and we will never see each other again.” When he heard these words, He cried his heart out.\n\nAn elderly woman neighbor named Liu felt sorry for him, so she compassionately offered He some food and three hundred small coins, telling him to go back home soon. His mother shared his sorrow and frustration, but had no remedy for it. Then she recalled the former guests who owed them money from their better days and decided that He should visit the wealthiest of them and ask for assistance, since the Lius had given them so much help back in those times.\n\n“They visited in the old days because we had money,” he replied. “If I could travel to them with a team of horses drawing a fine coach, it wouldn’t be hard to borrow even a thousand taels from them. But with our prospects as they are now, who’ll remember our past kindnesses and repay them? Besides, father loaned people money without receiving any kind of receipt from them and without asking anyone to serve as a guarantor, so there’s no way for us to demand repayment of the loans.”\n\nHis mother, however, remained adamant in her insistence. Thus he did as she requested. Over the course of more than twenty days, he wasn’t able to collect a single cent; only an actor named Li Si, who in the past had received the Liu family’s benevolent support, voluntarily sent He one tael when he heard about his family’s hard times. Thinking it just the way of the world, mother and son wept bitterly and henceforth gave up all hope for the marriage.\n\nHuang’s daughter meanwhile had reached the age of fifteen and heard that her father had broken the agreement with He because of his family’s poverty, which she felt was unconscionable. Huang wanted her to marry someone else.\n\nWeeping, the daughter told him, “Master Liu wasn’t born poor. But if he had been, and later became wealthy, would anyone turn him away? To reject him now just because he’s fallen on hard times is heartless!” Huang was displeased and tried to talk her into accepting his position. His daughter, however, wouldn’t budge. Her parents became furious with her and berated her from morning till night, yet she remained calm and held her ground through it all.\n\nNot long after this, the family was robbed one evening, and Huang and his wife were almost killed by red-hot irons as the bandits took all the family’s valuables, leaving them empty-handed. Three years passed quickly, and the Huang family’s financial decline only increased. They couldn’t stop thinking about the good times they’d had back when they were wealthy.\n\nThere was a merchant from the west who’d heard that Huang’s daughter was beautiful and he was willing to send fifty taels to secure a betrothal agreement. The money appealed to Huang, so he gave his approval to the marriage and was on the verge of forcing his daughter to comply with his will. But she could tell what he was up to, and so in anger she dressed in rags, smeared dirt on her face, and ran away, heading off into the night.\n\nAlone and with no one to count on, she begged for food by the roadsides, and for the next two months she made her way to Baoding, where she located He’s home and went straight there to meet his family. He’s mother, looking at her dirty face and ragged clothes, thought she was a beggar woman and hence tried to send her away. The daughter choked down her sobs and explained who she was. Deeply moved, He’s mother took her hand, weeping, and cried, “What a state you’ve been brought to!” The girl began sobbing again, joined by He and his mother.\n\nWhen the girl subsequently had a bath, it left her face glowing, her features bright and shining. Mother and son were both delighted. After several days, the mother held a simple wedding for the young couple. However, there were now three mouths to feed, and each day there was barely enough to eat. Weeping, He’s mother lamented, “My son and I deserve this; but I’m sorry that my virtuous daughter-in-law should suffer so!”\n\nThe girl smiled to comfort her and replied, “When I was among beggars recently, I came to understand their hardships, and though we’re having a hard time now, I feel like this is heaven compared to that suffering.” He’s mother couldn’t help but smile at this. Though they were poor, they lived a happy life and made their neighbors jealous of them.\n\nAs the girl walked through the empty rooms of the house one day, noticing how grass had grown up in all the unoccupied areas, she gradually came upon one room where dust had long been accumulating, and in one of its dark corners there was a pile of something that felt heavy and hard when she kicked at it with her foot. When she picked up a piece and wiped off the dust to see what it was, she discovered it was Zhushi silver. Amazed, she ran to tell He.\n\nGoing with her to see for himself, he realized that the ceramic shards and pebbles that had been tossed there in the old days by Gong Mengbi had all turned to silver. This made He think of the many times when he and Gong had buried pebbles under the tiles of the rooms—might they not also have turned to silver? He became worried while thinking of this, because much of the home had been mortgaged to the Liu family’s neighbors on the east. After discussing matters with his wife, He hurried to redeem it from them.\n\nTo their disappointment, most of the fragments lying around in the rooms proved to be nothing more than rubble, so He was very disappointed; but when they pulled up the floor tiles, they discovered the glorious brilliance of sparkling silver taels. In a few moments, they’d uncovered a vast treasure in silver.\n\nWith this he bought back the family farmland, hired some servants, and decorated their house, making the front entrance and courtyard even more prosperous-looking than they had been in the past. He fervently swore to himself, “If I don’t stand on my own two feet now, I’ll have betrayed uncle Gong!” Thus he dedicated himself to studying and in three years he passed the imperial examination at the provincial level.\n\nThen he personally took some of the silver and went to express his gratitude to his elderly neighbor, Mrs. Liu. He never forgot how she’d helped him in the past. His clothes dazzled the eye; there were more than ten servants with him, riding horses that looked as powerful as dragons. Mrs. Liu was very surprised by their visit, and since the old woman only had a single room, she had He sit together with her on her bed to chat. The lane was jammed with the noisy clamor of people and horses, and even her neighbor Huang could hear it.\n\nWhen Master Huang’s daughter ran away, the merchant from the west pressured him to return the betrothal money he’d sent, but Huang had already spent almost half of it, so he had to sell the family home to repay the amount. At that time, the Huang family became as destitute as Liu He formerly had been. When they heard that their once-intended son-in-law had been restored in fortune and prestige, they felt ashamed of themselves, sadly closed their doors and kept them shut.\n\nThe old woman bought some wine and prepared a meal to entertain He, where she described the virtues of the Huang daughter and regretted that she had vanished. “Are you married?” she asked him.\n\n“Yes,” he replied, “I am.”\n\nOnce they’d finished eating, He urged the old woman to come meet his bride and brought her home with him by carriage. When they arrived, the Huang daughter came out wearing a colorful gown, surrounded by a crowd of maidservants who clustered around her like she was a goddess. The old woman didn’t recognize her at first; when she realized that He’s wife was Huang’s daughter, she was quite surprised, and as they spoke together about the past, the girl eagerly asked about her parents. For the several days that she stayed with He and his wife, the old woman was treated courteously and munificently, dressed in nice clothing that was brand new from top to bottom, before she was returned home.\n\nThe old woman paid a visit to the Huang family, informing them about their daughter’s circumstances and delivering them her message to inquire about them. The husband and wife were amazed and ashamed to hear all this. The old woman advised Huang to go see his daughter, but he was reluctant. Later on, cold and hungry, embarrassed, he had no alternative but to head for Baoding.\n\nWhen he reached He’s magnificent gate, he saw how massive and resplendent it was, and the gatekeeper glared at him, making him wait all day long without informing the master. When a woman came out from the house, Huang, with humble words and manner, told her his name and begged her to please let his daughter know privately of his presence.\n\nAfter a little while, the woman came back out and led him into a side room, explaining, “My lady wants very much to see you; however, she fears that her husband will find out, so you’ll have to wait a while longer for an opportunity. When did you arrive here? Are you hungry?” Huang proceeded to complain about his suffering.\n\nThe woman brought him some wine and a couple dishes of food, serving them to Huang herself. Then she offered him five taels, saying, “The master is holding a banquet inside, so my lady is afraid she can’t come now. Tomorrow morning you should leave, so the master won’t find out that you’ve been here.” Huang guaranteed he would do so.\n\nIn the morning, he rose and hurriedly dressed, but since the gate hadn’t been unlocked yet, he had to stay inside, sitting on his traveling bag and waiting. Suddenly there was a noise and He came out. Huang was trying to slip away and hide himself when He spotted him and demanded to know who the old man was, and though the servants all knew, no one answered.\n\nAngrily, He cried, “This is undoubtedly some criminal! Grab him so he can be turned over to an official.” The servants quickly obeyed, taking out a short rope and binding him to a tree. Huang, ashamed and frightened, didn’t know what to say.\n\nBefore long, the woman Huang had seen the previous night came out, knelt before He, and said, “He’s my uncle. I didn’t tell you earlier because he arrived late last night.” He ordered the servants to untie Huang.\n\nThe woman walked with Huang to the gate, where she told him, “I forgot to tell the gatekeeper to let you out, so that’s what caused the problem. But my lady said that if you wish, you could send her mother to her, disguised as a flower seller and accompanied by old Mrs. Liu.” Huang agreed and went home, where he told his wife the plan.\n\nRealizing that she missed seeing her daughter, she told Mrs. Liu about the plan and so the two went together to He’s home. They had to pass through more than ten gateways to reach the daughter’s house. With her lustrous hair up in a high coil, the girl was wearing a fine silk gown decorated with pearl and jade ornaments, and a fragrant perfume one could not ignore; if she made the slightest comment, a crowd of senior and junior maidservants rushed in to be at her side. They moved her golden chair and bed for her, and adjusted her reclining chair. The maids then served tea; meanwhile, the daughter and her visitors exchanged greetings in code, as arranged, looking into each other’s eyes with brimming tears.\n\nWhen night fell, the two older women were taken to a room that had been specially prepared for them; the mattress was so warm and soft that even back when she’d been rich, Mrs. Huang had never experienced anything so nice. While they stayed there for a few days, the daughter’s relationship with her mother grew strong once again.\n\nWhenever they were alone together, the mother wept over how they’d wronged her. The daughter replied, “We’re mother and daughter, after all, so can’t you and I just forget what happened? But my husband can’t get over his anger at what you did, and we’re not going to let him know that you’re here.” Any time He made an appearance, Huang’s wife hurried away to hide.\n\nOne day, as they were speaking in private, He entered unexpectedly, saw his mother-in-law, and exploded in anger: “Where’d you come from, you old hag—how dare you come close enough to sit with my wife! I should order your hair to be yanked out!”\n\nOld woman Liu hastily intervened to say, “This is Wang, one of my relatives, the flower seller. She hasn’t done anything wrong, so please don’t blame her.” He then offered an apology for the mistake. Taking a seat, he commented, “For the past several days, I’ve been too busy to come and have a leisurely conversation with you. Are those old beasts in the Huang family still kicking?”\n\nWith a laugh, old woman Liu replied, “They’re all fine. But they’re so poor they can’t make ends meet. Now that you’re so wealthy and respected, why not think about showing some kindness as their son-in-law?”\n\nStriking the table, He cried, “If not for your compassion that day, sharing a cup of congee with me, I couldn’t have returned to my hometown! Now I’d like to skin them alive—that’s the kindness I’d show them!” As he spoke he grew furious, stamping his feet and jumping up and down, cursing.\n\nHis wife became equally agitated and declared, “They may not be humane, but they’re still my parents. I came here from far, far away, my hands chapped and frostbitten, the toes of my feet sticking out from my worn shoes, and I’ve never betrayed your trust. Why then do you curse my father, making me feel ashamed?” Restraining his anger, He turned and left.\n\nHuang’s wife, mortified and pale, said her farewells, wishing to return home. The daughter took twenty taels of her own money and gave them to her mother. Once the woman returned home, there was no further news from her, so her daughter couldn’t help but worry. Thus He sent servants to invite his in-laws to visit them.\n\nWhen Huang and his wife arrived, they felt too ashamed to show their faces. By way of apologizing for his earlier behavior, He explained, “Last year I would have been honored by your visit to our humble home, but you didn’t tell me who you were, so that’s why I behaved so offensively towards you.” Huang ingratiated himself repeatedly during He’s comments. Liu He saw to it that the Huangs were given fresh clothes and shoes.\n\nAfter they had stayed for more than a month, Huang began to feel uncomfortable, announcing several times that they were going home. Slipping him a hundred taels, He said, “The merchant from the west gave you fifty taels, so now I’m doubling that.” Huang, sweating nervously, felt deeply ashamed but accepted the money. Then He sent a carriage to take them home, and in their old age, the Huangs could be said to be reasonably well off.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The family that is prosperous and opens its doors to glad-handing parasites may later fall upon hard times, and finding itself suddenly abandoned by those visitors, turns angry, feeling hurt, and shuts its doors, no longer wishing to entertain such guests. However, a good friend who buries your bones, or turns rubble into money, may not be able to treat you with phony generosity or hospitality. If a person sits in the privacy of his home, enjoying the fact that his wealth supports him, as dignified as a lady at court, and is still as disloyal as Master Huang, how can he act that way and not be ashamed of himself? Heaven doesn’t bless us just so we can act like that.”\n\nThere was a rich man in our village who hoarded money and goods, an absolute miser. He kept several hundred taels in a pit, but was constantly afraid that someone would find out about them, so he wore clothes of cheap cloth and ate awful food in order to appear poor. When relatives and friends occasionally dropped by, he never made any dishes to feed them. If anyone happened to say that his family wasn’t poor, he’d glare at them and become angry, as though they were unreconcilable enemies.\n\nIn his old age, he continued to eat a _sheng_ of elm leaves and bark each day, so the skin on his arms hung loosely from them an inch long, but still he wouldn’t take any of the taels from the pit for his use. Consequently, he grew even more emaciated. Even when he was at death’s door, with his two sons standing around him and asking about it, he still wouldn’t tell them where the money was buried; by the time he felt he was really going to die and wanted to tell his sons the location, his tongue had become paralyzed and he couldn’t utter a sound, so he merely choked with sobs, feeling sorry for himself, and gasped in frustration.\n\nAfter his death, his son and grandsons couldn’t afford a coffin for him, so they buried him hastily without any covering. Alas! If a pit full of money is enough to make a man think he’s rich, then mustn’t the millions of taels in the state treasury make me fabulously wealthy? How foolish!",

One day, just as he was about to pass through Jiangzhou, the bird’s owner discovered that he’d used up all his traveling expenses, and in his distress he didn’t know what to do.\n\nThe bird said, “Why not sell me? Take me to the prince’s residence, where you can get a good price, and you won’t have to worry about being broke for your return home.”\n\n“I don’t have the heart to do it,” replied his owner.\n\n“There’s nothing to worry about,” said the bird. “When my new master pays you, just leave quickly and wait for me under the big tree that’s about twenty _li_ west of the city gate.” Then the owner agreed and left with the bird. He carried it to the city gate, where the two of them spoke back and forth, gradually attracting a crowd of onlookers.\n\nThere was a nobleman there who saw the bird and told the prince all about it. The prince summoned the owner and his bird, and informed the man that he wanted to buy it. The owner replied, “We’re fated to be together, so I don’t wish to sell it.”\n\nThen the prince asked the bird, “Do you want to live here?”\n\n“You bet I do,” it replied. The prince was delighted. The bird continued, “But it’ll cost you ten taels, which isn’t much to give. And don’t give him more than that.” The prince, who was even more delighted, stood up and handed over the ten taels immediately. The owner then pretended to be bitterly regretful and left.\n\nThe prince proceeded to speak some words to the bird, which answered him quite articulately. Then the prince ordered some meat to feed it. Once it finished eating, the bird declared, “I need to take a bath.” The prince ordered a golden basin to be filled with water and when its cover was lifted, the bird began its bath.\n\nWhen it finished bathing, it flew up to one of the rafters, preened itself and shook its wings, all the while keeping up a constant conversation with the prince. As soon as its wings were dry, it fluttered them and rose up in the air, crying as it did so, “Well, I’ve got to go!” The prince and his attendants looked all around, but they couldn’t find it. Then they turned their faces upward and heaved a heavy sigh.\n\nThey urgently searched for its owner, but he’d already vanished. Afterwards, someone who went to Shaanxi province saw the owner carrying the bird toward the market in Xi’an City. Mr. Bi Zaiji recalled this story for me.",

        "body": "Liu Haishi moved to Binzhou prefecture to escape all the chaos in Putai county. At the time, he was fourteen years old and attended the same private school as Liu Cangke, who was born in Binzhou, and since they were on very friendly terms, they agreed to treat each other as brothers. Not long after this, when Haishi lost his mother and father, he faithfully returned home to mourn them, and the two lost touch with each other.\n\nCangke’s family was quite wealthy. By the time he was forty, he had two sons: the eldest was very promising and by the age of seventeen was already recognized in his town as a literary talent; the next son was also very bright. Cangke also took as his concubine a woman in his town from the Yi family and cherished her greatly.\n\nWhen after about half a year his eldest son was afflicted by a brain fever and died, Cangke and his wife were devastated. Shortly afterwards, his wife also fell ill and died; several months later, his daughter-in-law also died; then even his servants died, all of them one after the other: Cangke grieved over the several deaths till he just couldn’t bear it any longer.\n\nOne day, as he was sitting in mourning, his gatekeeper suddenly announced Haishi’s arrival. Cangke, overjoyed, anxiously rushed out to welcome him in. As Cangke offered his affectionate, respectful greetings, Haishi suddenly declared in alarm, “Elder brother, don’t you know that you’ve caused the disaster that has destroyed your family?”\n\nCangke was stunned, unable to fathom how this could be. Haishi explained, “Though we lost touch with each other so long ago, I could tell that things had gone horribly wrong for you recently.” The tears ran down Cangke’s face at his friend’s words.\n\nHaishi sighed sadly. Then he smiled and said, “Your suffering isn’t over yet, so I’ve come to console you as you mourn for your losses. However, good fortune and opportunities are on the way, so please let me offer you my congratulations.”\n\n“It’s been a long time since we’ve seen each other, so have you become a ‘miracle worker’ recently?” Cangke asked.\n\n“That doesn’t happen to be one of my strengths,” Haishi replied. “In the mortal world, one can only perform within one’s capabilities, though one can become very adept with practice.” Cangke was greatly heartened and begged Haishi to examine his house and determine if something was wrong with it.\n\nWhen Haishi entered the house, he scrutinized everything, inside and out. Once he was finished, he asked to see all of Cangke’s family members; following his advice, Cangke sent for his surviving son and the son’s wife, a maid, and his concubine, so all of them could be examined in the main hall. Cangke delivered the instructions to each one of them.\n\nOnce Cangke had introduced his concubine, Ni, Haishi glanced up at the sky and then began laughing. The others, bewildered by this, then noticed that the concubine had gone pale and was beginning to tremble in fear—and as they watched, her body abruptly started to shrink violently, until soon she was only about two _chi_ tall.\n\nHaishi then picked up a ruler and hit her on the head, producing a sound as though he’d just struck a stone with a tool. Haishi grabbed her by the hair and checked the back of her head, where he found many strands of white hair and was about to yank them out. The concubine pulled her neck away from him and fell on her knees, weeping, saying that she was about to leave and begged him not to tear out her hair.\n\nHaishi angrily demanded, “Aren’t you through persisting in your evil yet?” He reached around the back of her neck and pulled out some of the white hairs. The woman immediately began to metamorphose, turning into a dark-colored fox. The others were utterly astonished.\n\nHaishi picked her up and stuck her inside his sleeve, then turned to the son’s wife and said, “You’ve already endured a profound cruelty, but I think there’s something strange on your back, so please allow me to examine it.” The wife, however, was shy and unwilling to expose the upper part of her body to him.\n\nWhen the son strongly insisted she do so, they discovered white hairs on her back, about four fingerbreadths long. Haishi employed an examining needle and declared, “These hairs already show signs of advanced age and in seven days it would have been too late to save her.”\n\nThen they examined Cangke’s younger son and found the hairs on him, too, but only two fingerbreadths long. “At this rate, he could have died in about a month,” Haishi reported. Cangke and the maidservant were then each pricked with the needle. Haishi noted, “If I hadn’t come, all of your family members would have died.”\n\n“What about her?” Cangke asked of the maid.\n\n“She’s also a kind of fox,” he explained. “They suck up the victim’s active _qi_ until it’s fatal to the human.”\n\n“I know I haven’t seen you for a long time,” Cangke replied, “but how can you know about such mystical things! Have you become a god?”\n\nWith a laugh, Haishi replied, “I was permitted to study with a master and through practice obtained a modest degree of skill, but that hardly makes me a god.” Cangke asked him about his master, and Haishi explained, “He’s a Shanshi Daoist. Since the one fox is evil, I can’t kill it, but must return and deliver this captive to my master.”\n\nOnce he finished speaking, he took his leave of Cangke and his family. Suddenly feeling that his sleeve was empty, Haishi exclaimed, “I forgot! There are some long hairs at the end of its tail that I didn’t remove, so it’ll have already gotten loose by now.”\n\nThe group was shocked by this turn of events. Haishi assured them, “Since the neck hairs have already been plucked out, it can’t turn into a person and can only transform itself into another beast, so if it’s just escaped, it won’t have gotten far.”\n\nThereupon he entered the house and looked over the cat, then came back out and checked Cangke’s dog, but neither were the evil fox. Haishi then opened the gate to the pig pen and called out, “Here you go.” Cangke watched the bunch of pigs and found there was one extra. When he heard Haishi laugh, he stopped and didn’t dare do anything.\n\nHaishi caught the extra pig by its ears and saw a long hair in its tail which was as hard as a needle. When he began to remove the hair, the pig became skittish and started squealing to disrupt the plucking.\n\nHaishi said to it, “You’ve done great evil to many people, so if I pull out one of your hairs, how can you complain?” He grasped it and plucked out the hair, and as a result it turned back into a fox creature.\n\nAfter he’d stashed it inside his sleeve, he expressed his wish to leave. Cangke pleaded with him to stay and prepared a meal for him. He asked Haishi when he might see him again, and his friend said in farewell, “It’s hard to say. My master has a great will, often sending me to wander the world and rescue people, so we may meet again some day.”\n\nOnce Haishi had left, Cangke thought about the name of Haishi’s master and in a sudden flash of recognition he declared, “Haishi really is almost a god! The characters making up ‘Shanshi’ combine into the character for ‘rock,’ the name that Master Lu Yan, whom even the gods all respected, used when referring to himself.”",

About ten mighty bandits, who were quite infamous, had been captured in Yidu prefecture and were punished above the site of the deep pool. Their ghosts began to haunt the place, causing mischief, and anyone who passed by the pool would be pulled in and drowned.\n\nOne day, there was a certain honest fellow who’d fallen upon hard times and happened along there, when suddenly he heard the voices of a crowd of ghosts fleeing in terror, crying, “Minister Shi is here!” Shortly afterwards, the minister arrived indeed, and the man reported to him what he’d heard.\n\nMinister Shi took some lime and wrote a notice on the wall standing there, displaying the words, “I, Shi, as an official, forbid you to carry out your evil here: in view of the fact that you were committed to doing harm, angering heaven and causing people harm, you were executed; you must no longer carry out your unnatural plans, or you’ll be destroyed as punishment for your crimes. Your only hope for being reincarnated is to stop killing people and to repent your wickedness, so vie with each other to see who can become the most penitent; if you cleanse the blood stains from your bones, you’ll be able to escape this degradation.

You’re fit for nothing but staying in the tomb, and this world still has jurisdiction over the lives of its people; do you really think a Minister is going to let you get away with being dangerous and uncontrollable?\n\n“This official notice dictates that each of you must no longer persist in doing evil. Your bones lie somewhere uncertain near the river, but you must wait calmly and silently for your transmigration; then your spirits will be able to return to your home villages. If you reject your past faults and present evil, you certainly won’t regret it in the future!”\n\nFrom that time on, the ghostly violence ceased, and the deep pool gradually dried up.",

As the servant stared in disbelief, it turned and ran behind the house.\n\nHe quickly got up and stealthily followed it into the garden, where it then turned into a woman. The servant realized she must be a fox spirit, and went back to his room. After a while, the woman came to him, and he pretended to be asleep so he could watch her. Then she bent over him and shook him.\n\nThe servant acted as though he’d just awakened and asked her who she was. The woman didn’t answer him. “Did you come from the bright light up there?” he wondered.\n\nShe replied, “Since you already know the answer, why are you asking me?” Then they spent the night together there. From then on, they met together every night, and though she always had to leave at daylight, they gradually became accustomed to each other’s company.\n\nWhen Han found out about this, he sent two men to sleep beside the servant. Surprisingly, however, they would find themselves sleeping on the floor without any knowledge of how they’d come to be there during the night.\n\nMaster Han became even more upset, so he summoned the servant and said, “That thing’s coming here regularly and I want you to capture it the next time it appears; otherwise, I’ll have you whipped!” The servant didn’t dare argue, so he promised he would do so and withdrew.\n\nHe thought to himself that catching the fox would be difficult; but he was also afraid of the punishment he’d receive if he didn’t catch it. He went round and round, unable to settle upon a strategy. Suddenly he recalled that the woman had a small, body-hugging red blouse that she refused to take off, even briefly, so surely this was a vital area, and if he held her there, then he could grab her sides.\n\nAt midnight, she arrived and asked him, “Did your master order you to capture me?”\n\n“He certainly did,” Han replied. “But we’re getting along so well, how could I possibly bring myself to do it?” As she fell asleep, he furtively grabbed her blouse with both hands. The woman immediately burst into tears, tore off the blouse with all her strength and ran off. Subsequently, he lost track of her.\n\nLater, when the servant was returning home from somewhere else, he spotted the woman off in the distance, sitting by the side of the road; when he approached her, she raised her sleeve to hide her face. He got down from his horse and asked, “What are you doing here like this?”\n\nThe woman stood up, took his hand and replied, “I wanted to say that I understand that you’ve already forgotten our old relationship. Yet lovers can never entirely forget their tender affections for each other, so it’s still possible to rekindle those feelings. You only did what your master ordered you to do, so it wasn’t really your fault. But our destiny has already run its course, and today I’ve brought you some wine, so please come inside where we can share it together and then say our farewells.” It was autumn at the time and the sorghum in the fields stood ripe and abundant.\n\nThe woman took the servant by the hand and led him to a large mansion. He tied up his horse and they went inside, where wine and delicacies had already been laid out for them. As soon as they sat down, a crowd of female servants served the wine and brought the food to them.\n\nAt sunset, the servant declared that he had business to take care of, and that he had to report back to his master, so they said farewell to each other. As soon as he stepped out of the mansion, he found himself alone in the middle of a sorghum field in Gansu province.",

They said they’d been traveling from the west. They’d heard that the prefect here was a devout Buddhist, so they’d come to visit him. The prefect sent two servants to escort them to a Buddhist monastery.\n\n“A monk there named Lingpei who supervised the monastery’s affairs wasn’t so hospitable to them. But when Lingpei’s servants saw how special the visitors looked, they decided to receive them personally, so they stopped at the monastery to stay overnight.\n\n“Someone asked the two foreign monks, ‘Since there are many enlightened individuals in the cities to the west, isn’t it possible you arhats possess some extraordinary skills?’\n\n“One of the foreign monks gave a smiling laugh, stretched a hand out from one of his sleeves, and in his palm he held out a tiny pagoda, carved with intricate details for its size, altogether a delicately wrought, lovely piece.\n\n“At the highest point on the wall, there was a small niche, so the monk tossed the pagoda up into it, and it landed perfectly upright, without touching or leaning against anything. They watched as Buddhist relics inside the pagoda began to emit a glow that illuminated the entire room.\n\n“A little while later, the monk held out his hand invitingly, and the pagoda dropped into his palm as before. The other foreign monk then laid bare his left arm and began extending it till it reached six or seven _chi_ in length, while his right arm began to shorten till it was like he didn’t even have one; then he turned and extended his right arm until it was the same length and the left one shortened to nothing.”",

        "title": "The Fox Concubine",
        "body": "Liu Dongjiu, from Laiwu county, served as a government official for Fenzhou prefecture. As he sat by himself in his public office, he heard laughter and discussion coming towards him from outside the office hall. Four women then entered his office: one was about forty, one might have been thirty, one was twenty-four or twenty-five, and the last one was still a young girl. They stood before his table there almost like a single being, just staring at him and smiling. Liu knew that foxes liked to frequent the government office, so he decided not to pay any attention to them.\n\nAfter a little while, the girl took out a red scarf and playfully tossed it over Liu’s face. He plucked it off and threw it out the window, then ignored them as before. The four laughed and then left.\n\nOne day, the eldest of the four arrived and told Liu, “I think my youngest sister has marital bonds to you by destiny, so she hopes you won’t overlook her good points when considering her shortcomings.” Liu responded indifferently. The woman consequently went away.\n\nAfter a short while, she returned with a maidservant who was accompanying the young girl; the maid then had her sit down next to Liu. The elder sister declared to her, “Such a perfect couple—tonight is your wedding night, so you’d better try hard to serve Master Liu well. I’ll leave you now.”\n\nLiu examined the girl closely and realized that she was uniquely pretty, so they slept together. He asked about her background, and she replied, “I’m definitely not a person now, but I was really a person before. I was originally an official’s daughter until I was possessed by fox magic and suddenly died, and then was just buried in our garden. A group of foxes used their magic to give me life again, so I was able to float in the air like a fox.” Liu took his hand and traced her spine down her bare back.\n\nThe girl felt this and asked with a laugh, “Why not just ask if I have a tail?” She stood up and turned her body around, encouraging him, “Please take your hand and find out for yourself.” From then on, she stayed with him and didn’t leave. Everywhere she went, the maidservant accompanied her. Liu’s family members respectfully treated her as the wife of an official, and the female servants who went to greet her were generously given gift money.\n\nWhen it came to Liu’s birthday feast, a vexing overflow of well-wishers attended the celebration, and altogether more than thirty dinner tables were needed; they sent out a call for additional help, but only one or two additional cooks showed up. Liu couldn’t bear for anyone to be disappointed. The fox concubine realized this and reassured him, “Don’t worry. Since there aren’t enough cooks to meet the demand, perhaps it would just be best to dismiss them altogether. While my own talents may be quite limited, serving guests at thirty tables will be no problem at all.” Liu, relieved to hear this, directed the servants to prepare fish and meat spiced with ginger and cinnamon, and then to move the dishes into the inner house.\n\nFrom inside the house, people could hear the sound of knives on cutting boards, chopping ceaselessly with expert precision. A small table was set up inside one doorway where the servants who carried dishes of meat then placed them, and when they turned around, they found the table full of delicious dishes made from what they’d just carried in. Over ten servants kept carrying in raw materials and taking out skillfully prepared dishes without pause.\n\nFinally the kitchen crew went to ask for some noodle soup. They heard the concubine say, “The host didn’t inform us in advance, so what can we do on such short notice?” She called for the crew to carry out the noodle soup. As everyone watched, over thirty steaming bowls appeared on the table.\n\nOnce the guests had left, the fox concubine told Liu, “You need to offer some money as reimbursement for this noodle soup.” Liu asked some of his servants to go directly to the family who’d made the soup. The people there had been unsettled by the disappearance of their noodle soup; but when Liu’s servants arrived and explained the situation, the mystery was finally settled.\n\nOne night, as they were enjoying some wine, Liu felt a nostalgic longing for Shandong spring wine. His fox concubine asked Liu to allow her to get some. Then she stepped through their gate and returned in a short while, saying, “There’s a pot outside the gate, enough to supply you for several days.” Liu took a look, and there was wine there indeed, a sizeable jar of Shandong spring wine.\n\nWhen several days had passed, Liu’s first wife dispatched two servants to go into Fenzhou, to serve Liu at his office. On the way, one of the servants naively commented, “I’ve heard that this fox wife is very free with gifts of money, so maybe when we go to visit her to offer greetings, we’ll receive enough gift money to buy a fur coat.”\n\nThe fox wife was at the government office where Liu worked, and already knew all about this, so she turned to Liu and said, “Some men from your household are just about to arrive. One’s a detestable, low-birth, impertinent slave, and I should give him some kind of punishment.”\n\nThe next day, as soon as the naïve servant entered the city, he developed a splitting headache and came with his fellow into Liu’s office, holding his head and howling in pain. The servants had figured that they needed to get the man some medicine. Liu laughed and said, “He doesn’t need a cure, he just needs some time to recover.” Liu’s other servants were worried that the naïve fellow might have offended Liu’s wife. The naïve servant thought to himself: we’ve just arrived, and I haven’t had a chance even to unpack yet, so how could I possibly have caused any trouble? Hence he did nothing but plead with Liu, crawling on his knees and lamenting his pain.\n\nFrom behind a screen came the words, “You made reference to a ‘wife,’ but did you also need to add the word ‘fox’ to it?” The servant then realized that his words had been overheard, and he began kowtowing repeatedly. Again the voice said, “Though you wanted to get a fur coat, what would granting it be but to encourage your impertinence?” After a pause, the voice concluded, “You’re recovered now.” As soon as the words were spoken, it was like the servant’s pain had simply vanished.\n\nOnce the servant had obsequiously paid his respects and wished to leave, a bundle was suddenly flung at him from behind the screen with the comment, “Here’s a lamb’s fleece coat, so now you can leave.” The servant opened it and discovered five taels inside it.\n\nLiu asked for news about his household and the servant told him that everything was fine, except that one night a jar of special wine had disappeared. When they recalled the date that it vanished, it turned out to be the very night that the fox concubine had fetched the wine for him. The servants were afraid that she was a god and called her “blessed immortal.” Liu commissioned a small portrait of her.\n\nAt that time, Zhang Daoyi, who was a commissioner of education, having heard of the fox concubine’s extraordinary talents, paid Liu a friendly visit on the pretext that they came from the same hometown, and expressed his wish to meet her. The fox wife, however, refused the request.\n\nWhen Liu showed him her portrait, Zhang forcibly took it from him and left. When he got home, he hung it up beside a seat and did obeisance to it each morning and night, saying, “With your beauty, can anything you wish be impossible? Why choose old Liu! Wouldn’t you rather be with me as your patron?”\n\nAt the office, Liu’s fox wife suddenly said to him, “I’m going to have to punish that impertinent Master Zhang for being so rude to me.”\n\nOne day, Zhang had just made his obeisance to the portrait when it was like someone had suddenly hit him in the forehead with an ink box, the injury causing him extreme pain. Terrified, he returned the portrait. Liu asked him why he was doing so, but Zhang kept his motives secret and gave him an evasive answer.\n\nLiu laughed and inquired, “It wouldn’t be because you have a pain in the forehead, would it?” Realizing he couldn’t deceive Liu, Zhang told him the truth.\n\nSoon Liu’s son-in-law, Qi Shenglai, begged to meet the concubine for a visit. The fox wife firmly rejected the idea. Qi then came and begged him even more insistently. Liu told the concubine, “He’s not just some stranger, so why are you refusing him so rigidly?”\n\n“He wants to meet me,” replied his fox wife, “expecting that I’ll offer him some kind of present in return. He’s hoping that I’ll be extravagant, but nothing I can offer would satisfy his aspirations, and that’s why I don’t want to see him. However, since he’s continued to invite me so insistently, I promise to see him in ten days.”\n\nWhen the time had elapsed, Qi entered and bowed respectfully before a bamboo curtain that concealed the fox concubine. He could see her figure only vaguely, but didn’t dare approach to check more closely; instead, he withdrew several paces outside at once, constantly turning his eyes back as he did so to watch her. That’s when he heard her say, “Our son-in-law is turning back to stare at me!”\n\nA roaring laugh followed these words, as piercing as the screech of an owl. When Qi heard this, his legs went weak and shook like he was frightened out of his wits. Once he was outside, he sat down for a bit till he began to feel a little more steady. Then he declared, “When I heard the sound of that laughter, like thunder and storm, I couldn’t feel my whole body.”\n\nIn a short while, acting on the fox’s orders, a maid came and gave Qi twenty taels. He accepted them, and told the maid, “The ‘blessed immortal’ has lived with my father-in-law for some time, so how can she not know that I’m used to spending a lot of money—considerably more than this?”\n\nThe fox concubine heard this and replied, “I certainly had him pegged. The bottom of my purse turned out to be empty; I asked someone to accompany me to Bianliang, but the city was occupied by the Yellow River God, and all its many stores were underwater—and though we dove in to get some money for him, was that enough to satisfy his greedy desire? Besides, though I could indulge him with a generous present, his own fortune is too weak to match it.”\n\nSince the fox wife could foretell things that would happen in the future, whenever Liu encountered some problems and discussed them with her, she always analyzed them for him. One day while she was sitting down, she suddenly looked up into the sky in shock and said, “Something terrible’s going to take place, so what can we do about it!” Frightened, Liu asked about his own family members and she replied, “I know that they’ll be safe and sound—only your second son needs to be worried about anything. Before long, this place is going to become a battlefield, so you should request to be transferred far away and leave, if I’m to avert a disaster.”\n\nLiu followed her advice, delivered the request to his superior, and received an assignment to supervise the military supplies being transported to Yungui. It was a long, faraway journey to make, so everyone felt sorry for him when they heard the news, and only the fox concubine congratulated him.\n\nSoon there was a violent rebellion, and Fenzhou’s official buildings were captured. Liu’s second son, coming from Shandong, was caught up in the disturbances and murdered. Once the city was captured, all of the officials suffered great misfortunes, and only Master Liu’s departure could have allowed him to escape. Once the plundering had settled down, Liu started to head home.\n\nAlthough he himself was innocent, he was forced to suffer for others’ rebellious misdeeds; while traveling, he was so broke that he couldn’t afford to eat both breakfast and supper; and making things even more difficult, the officials he met on his way home asked him for money and he became so hard-up and worried about it that he just wanted to die. The fox wife told him, “Don’t despair, under your bed you’ll find three thousand taels, and you can use it to provide for your needs.”\n\nLiu was overjoyed and asked, “From where was it stolen?”\n\n“Some things in the world simply have no owner,” she replied, “so if one uses some of them, that hardly seems like stealing.” Liu spent the money the fox wife had provided for him to settle all of his difficulties and return to his hometown, and she followed him all the way.\n\nAfter several years she suddenly vanished, leaving behind several paper-wrapped gifts, inside which were little banners about two _cun_ long, the sort that grieving families hang above their gates, and everyone considered this most inauspicious. Liu subsequently died while looking for her.",

        "body": "Le Yunhe and Xia Pingzi grew up together, studied together as classmates, and became inseparable friends. Xia was so bright, he was already well-known by the age of ten. Le modestly studied hard with Xia, who helped him tirelessly, and Le’s skills at writing increased till he earned an equally impressive reputation for his writings. But Xia always failed the civil service examination and became depressed as a result.\n\nUnfortunately, Xia became infected by plague and died, but his family was so poor that they couldn’t afford to bury him, so Le took charge and provided a funeral. Xia left behind an infant son in swaddling clothes and a widow, and Le provided for his friend’s entire family; whenever he got some food, he split it in two and gave them half, so Xia’s wife and son were able to survive by depending upon Le’s help. Hence his reputation as a worthy individual grew even greater.\n\nLe, who didn’t own much real estate but still had to find a way to support Xia’s family, found his situation getting worse and worse, so he sighed and exclaimed, “A great talent like Pingzi can be considered mediocre and die, while circumstances have had me step into his place! You should pursue wealth when young in order to have enough time to enjoy it, for if you just think about it all the time without acting, you may die prematurely, your life wasted, so you’d better find a way to make a living as soon as possible.”\n\nThereupon he gave up studying and began to conduct some business. He took over the Xia family’s finances for half a year, and the family’s fortunes became a little more stable while his own life also improved.\n\nOne day, he was having a break at an inn in Jinling. There he saw a man who was tall and thin, with an otherwise large physique, sitting to the side as though possessed of some great misery, gloomily wearing a sorrowful expression. “Would you like me to get you something to eat?” Le asked him. The man didn’t say a word.\n\nLe pushed some of his food over to him; the man grabbed with both hands to eat it, and in a moment it was already gone. Le then ordered enough food to feed two people for the man, and once again he quickly finished it all. Then Le directed the inn’s host to bring over a pork shoulder piled upon steamed cakes; the man devoured enough to feed several men, and when his hunger was finally satisfied, he thanked Le, explaining, “For over three years, I haven’t been this full.”\n\n“You’re obviously a mighty warrior,” observed Le, “so why have you drifted aimlessly to a place like this?”\n\nThe man replied, “Heaven has been punishing me for a crime, and I was unable to speak.” Le asked him where he lived, and the man explained, “I have no house, no land, nor a boat in the river; I show up to a village in the morning and appear in a city at sunset.” As Le then took his luggage and prepared to leave, the man followed along with him, so loyally attached that he wouldn’t leave his side. Le tried to say farewell to him. But the man replied, “You will suffer a great loss, and I couldn’t bear to forget the kindness of a cooked meal.” Le thought it rather strange, but then agreed and they traveled on together.\n\nEn route, he wanted to get something for the two of them to eat. The man then declined, commenting, “In an entire year, I only eat a few meals.” This seemed even more strange.\n\nThe next day while they were crossing the river, a violent tempest sprang up and when the ferryboat capsized, Le and the man both sank into the river.\n\nAfter a while, the wind calmed and the man carried Le on his back through the waves till they could climb up into a passenger boat, then the man jumped back into the waves again; a moment later, he came back with a boat and helped Le climb aboard, urging him to lie down and rest, then once again he leapt into the river, emerging from it with both arms full of the merchant’s goods which Le had been transporting, and which the man tossed up into the boat; then once again he dove down: he submerged and resurfaced several times, until the cargo he’d been bringing up filled their boat.\n\nThanking him, Le said, “It was enough for you to save my life, but I never could have expected to get my cargo back!” He inspected the valuable cargo and determined that there seemed to be nothing missing. This made Le even happier, and he was amazed that the man was so godlike.\n\nLe wanted them to continue on their way; when the man told him he must stay behind, Le entreated him to stay with him, and so together they crossed the river. Le smiled and said, “This misfortune is over, and all I lost was a single golden hairpin.” His companion wanted to jump into the river and search for it. Le tried to persuade him to stop, but by then the man had already jumped back into the river and was no longer visible.\n\nLe just stood there for a long time, stupefied. Suddenly he saw the man leap out of the river with a smile, holding up the hairpin as he said, “It’s fortunate that I didn’t fail to accomplish my mission.” The people in the boat were all astonished by his dedication.\n\nLe then returned home with him, and the two shared Le’s house. Every ten days or so, the man would eat a meal, consuming so much while feeding that it was difficult to keep track of it all.\n\nOne day, when the man again said he was leaving, Le as a matter of course tried to dissuade him. Just then the daylight dimmed like it was going to rain and they heard the sound of thunder. Le wondered aloud, “What must it look like among the clouds? And for that matter, what kind of thing is thunder? If only I could climb into the sky and have a look at them, my questions could be answered.”\n\nHis companion laughed and asked, “Do you really want to take a trip among the clouds?”\n\nA bit later, Le felt very tired, so he laid down on his bed to take a nap. When he awoke, his body felt shaky, like he was no longer lying on his bed; he opened his eyes and discovered his body surrounded by thin clouds that looked like wadded cotton. Startled into getting up, he found himself dizzy, as though he was on a boat. When he tried to walk away, the ground felt soft rather than solid. He looked up at the stars to get some perspective on what was happening, but they were right in front of his eyes. Then he began to suspect he was merely dreaming.\n\nHe looked carefully at the stars suspended in the sky like mature lotus-seeds that had gone puffy, the large ones reminding him of urns, the medium-sized ones looking like bowls, and the small ones resembling little pitchers or basins. When he tried to touch them with his hands, the large ones were too firmly fixed to move; then the small stars began to vibrate like he could pick them up and take them down from the sky. He found himself able to pluck one of the stars successfully and hide it in his sleeve.\n\nWhen he moved some of the clouds aside so he could see below, he noticed that the ground looked as boundless as the sea, and he saw that the cities looked no larger than beans. Astounded, he thought about his situation: if he were to fall, he wondered how he could possibly hope to survive.\n\nIn that instant, he saw two supple dragons in silk harnesses drawing a wagon. Their tails snapped behind them like ox-tail whips. There were storage vessels on the wagon, all of them several _zhang_ in circumference, filled to the brim with water. There were about ten or so men who drew out water with other containers and splashed it into the clouds all around them.\n\nSuddenly they spotted Le and thought his presence there altogether strange. Le discovered that his companion was there with them, and the man told the others, “He’s my friend.” He gave Le a container and asked him to splash along with them. At that time, there was a severe drought in that region, and as Le picked up a container, he moved the clouds till he could see his hometown and was able to pour as much as he liked all around the area.\n\nShortly thereafter, the man told Le, “I used to serve as the Administrator of Thunder. For failing to make it rain at the right time, I was given a three-year punishment; today I’ve fulfilled my sentence, so please allow me to say goodbye to you.”\n\nThen as they were driving the wagon, the man threw down an impossibly long rope in front of Le and asked him to grab the upper end of it. Le was worried that he was done for. His large companion laughed and assured him, “Nothing dangerous is going to happen to you.” At these words, Le did as he was told and found himself on the ground in a flash.\n\nHe looked around and found himself standing just outside his village; the rope was gradually pulled back up into the clouds until he could no longer see it. Then where the long-standing drought had reached for ten _li_, it rained till there was nearly a surplus of water, though only in Le’s village were all of the ditches between the fields filled.\n\nWhen he got home, he looked inside his sleeve andfound that the star he’d plucked from the sky was still there. He took it out and placed it on a table, noting that it was dark, like a stone; but at nightfall, it emitted a brilliant light that reflected brightly off the room’s walls. It seemed so precious that he wrapped it up in a bag and hid it. Each time he received an honored visitor, he took it out to illuminate the room while they drank together. As soon as they laid eyes on it, it always flashed its light.\n\nOne night, Le’s wife was sitting in front of the stone, combing her hair, when suddenly she saw its light gradually decrease until it was no brighter than a firefly, and it began flying all around. By the time she realized how strangely it was behaving, it had already flown into her mouth and though she tried to cough it up, it wouldn’t come out, till eventually it just went down her throat. Shaken up, she ran to tell Le, who was also startled.\n\nJust after they had fallen asleep, Le dreamt that Xia Pingzi came to him and said, “I am that tiny star. You were kind and good to me, and I’ve never forgotten that. It was our fate for you to pick me from the sky and carry me home. Now I can be your heir, in order to thank you for your great virtue.” Le was thirty but still had no children, so this dream made him very happy.\n\nOf course, his wife soon became pregnant; and as the time drew near for her to give birth, a dazzling light filled the house like a star that had nearly reached its zenith in the sky, and so they named the infant boy, “Xing’er.” He proved to be extraordinarily intelligent. When he was just sixteen, he became a successful candidate in the highest level of the civil service examination.\n\nThe collector of these tales remarks, “If Le’s son were to develop a reputation for literary work that became widely known and suddenly found the position he was occupying wasn’t the one he’d been fated to adopt, would it be any less strange for him to just throw away his writing brush, like taking off a pair of slippers, than it was for Ban Chao when he decided to join the army? The tiny star was able to thank his friend, Le, because Le gave the Administrator of Thunder a meal out of kindness, and there could hardly have been a better way for the immortal to repay his private debt of gratitude than by participating in the creation of that son, as testament to Le’s virtue.”",

He was capable of mastering many magical abilities and people all called him “the immortal.” My late father had a wonderful friendship with him, so every time he came to town, Han would visit him.\n\nOne day, my late uncle, Pu Zhu, and I were planning to visit Han when we happened to run into him while on the way. Han handed a key to us and said, “Please go open the gate and take a seat, I’ll be back soon.” Then we did as he said. When we arrived at the monastery and opened the bolt on the gate, we found Han already sitting inside. This kind of thing happens all the time there.\n\nAt that time, one of my relatives was addicted to gambling, and because of my late father, he also knew Han the Daoist. A monk from Great Buddha Temple who was skilled at dice games and always bet large amounts of money on them came to town. My relative saw him and was delighted, so he took out all his savings and went to gamble with him, but lost heavily; becoming even more obsessed with betting, he mortgaged his real estate and went back again to gamble with the monk, but over the course of the night he lost everything.\n\nDepressed over his losses, he decided to pay a special visit to Han on the way home. Noticing my relative’s low spirits, Han asked him what had happened and he told him the whole truth. Han laughed and said, “If you gamble all the time, it’s only reasonable that you’ll invariably suffer losses. If you can quit gambling once and for all, I can help you regain what you’ve lost.”\n\n“If I could get my money back,” replied my relative, “I’d gladly use an iron stick to smash the dice into pieces!”\n\nThen Han took out a piece of paper and wrote magic figures on it, instructing my relative to wear it around his waist between his clothing and his belt. “You should stop as soon as you win everything back,” cautioned the Daoist. “Don’t try to win more money than you’ve already lost.” Han then gave my relative a thousand coins and had him promise that later he would return it when he won his money back.\n\nMy relative was overjoyed and went off to wager. The monk counted my relative’s money and refused to gamble with him, thinking he had too little to wager. But my relative strongly insisted on throwing the dice just once. The monk laughed and then agreed to gamble with him. My relative took the thousand coins and used them all as his stake.\n\nThe monk gave the dice a toss without winning or losing, then my relative took the dice and succeeded in tossing it to the winning side; the monk took out another two thousand coins as stakes for a second wager, and though when he tossed the dice they appeared to be rolling to the winning side, once my relative blew at them, they rolled to the losing side. When he counted the money he’d won from the monk, my relative found that he’d won almost all of his money back.\n\nSecretly he started thinking again of winning several thousand more, and how great everything would be then, but then the dice starting going bad again; he had a feeling that something wasn’t right, so he stood up and looked at his belt, discovering that the charm was gone, then in shock he immediately stopped.\n\nHe gathered up his money and went back to the monastery, where he wanted to settle his debt with Han, and afterwards he counted out the money he had left, discovering that it was exactly the amount he had actually lost before. When he was finished, he ashamedly apologized for losing the charm.\n\nHan laughed and said, “I’ve already got my charm right here. Indeed, I warned you about your insatiable habit, but you wouldn’t listen, and that’s why I took it back.”\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “In all the world, nothing can cause one to lose one’s property so quickly as gambling; and in all the world, nothing can erode one’s morality so completely as gambling. Getting involved in it is like wading into the ocean without knowing where the bottom is. A man who wishes to be an agricultural merchant first has to cultivate the agriculture; and to be a scholar one has to cherish every moment of time available to study. Studying something tirelessly is the right way to build one’s career; but meeting friends just to chat and to share an occasional drink together is also a decent way to enjoy life.\n\n“Becoming close with vicious friends and gambling all night long is totally self-defeating. It’s like emptying one’s purse into a small chest and then suspending it precipitously in the air for other gamblers to take their chances at getting it; the shouting sound gamblers make when they toss the dice shows that they want to win the money so badly that they project their spirit into the very dice. Tossing the dice is like throwing a pearl away; holding the cards for wagers is like a palace beauty holding a bamboo fan. One can look left and right at other players, straining the eyes to cheat; or one can feign weakness outwardly while secretly acting decisively, though neither approach employs one’s talents to much effect.\n\n“When one’s house is filled with guests, the gambler still lingers at the betting game; even when the house is on fire, the gambler still stares at the latest round of wagers. Forgetting to eat and abandoning sleep, over time one becomes disoriented, babbling oneself hoarse like a demon.\n\n“Even if a man loses everything by gambling it away, he sticks around watching others betting. He’ll stand in the middle of it all, howling encouragement, itching to show off his special talent; but reaching into an empty money bag that’s open at both ends is enough to put fear into even a warrior’s heart. The gambler cranes his neck and paces back and forth, but once he discovers that he has nothing left, there’s no help for it; hanging his head, devastated, only then, under the cover of black night, does he go home.\n\n“Fortunately, his wife—who’s often complained about his behavior—has fallen asleep, but he still fears that the barking of the dog may awaken her; for quite some time he’ll be troubled by the emptiness of a starving belly, certain to resent having to eat leftover gruel. Subsequently he’ll sell his own children and mortgage his fields to raise some money in hopes of winning back everything’s he’s lost; but against his expectations, his stakes are used up, everything gone and all to no avail. When he suffers such a defeat and thinks about it afterwards, he finally realizes it’s a rotten shame; and if one asks whom among gamblers had the best ending, people will point to the man who has lost his money and his clothes.\n\n“But because an empty stomach’s unbearable to the gambler, he subsequently turns to banditry; and though it’s endlessly perplexing, alas, he even has to depend upon the dowry his wife received from her family for her wedding! His wicked conduct engages him in losing his moral identity, his estate, and his life, which certainly isn’t what he was betting on!”"

        "body": "Jing Xing from Wendeng had been famous ever since he was young. His next door neighbor was a scholar named Chen, and only a low wall separated their studies. One evening, Chen was passing through some abandoned ruins when he heard a young woman sobbing among the pine and cypress trees; as he drew near, he noticed a silk band suspended from a tree branch, as though the young woman was about to hang herself.\n\nWhen Chen asked her who she was, she wiped away her tears and replied, “My mother has traveled far away, and left me in the care of my cousin. But he has a wicked heart, and the beast won’t let me stay any longer. It’d be better to die than to be abandoned like this!” When she finished speaking, she renewed her sobbing.\n\nChen untied the band and advised her that she should consider marrying someone. The girl worried that there was no man around her upon whom she could depend. Chen invited her to stay temporarily at his home, and she accepted his offer.\n\nOnce they’d arrived there, Chen lit a lamp and looked closely at the girl, discovering her to possess a rare grace and charm. Overwhelmed with delight, he wanted to make love with her. With a stern voice, the girl refused and the sounds of their ruckus reached Chen’s neighbor. Jing came over the wall to sneak a peek, so Chen let loose of the girl. When she saw Jing, she stared at him for quite a while, then ran off. The two men chased after her but couldn’t tell where she’d disappeared to.\n\nJing went home, shut the door, and was about to get ready for bed, when the graceful young woman stepped out from his room. Startled, he asked her what she was doing there, and she replied, “Chen is lacking in both virtue and fortune, so I can’t choose him as my lifelong mate.” This made Jing very happy, so he asked her for her name. “For generations my people have lived in Linzi,” she explained. “My family name is Qi and my nickname is A-Xia.” When they entered the bedroom, Jing teased her seductively while A-Xia just laughed, not really trying to resist him, and so they slept together.\n\nMany of Jing’s friends came to visit him in his studio, while A-Xia remained hidden in one of the inner rooms. After several days had passed, A-Xia told him, “I have to leave here for the time being. All this coming and going is too disturbing, and I’m just tired of it. From now on, please look for me to come at night.”\n\n“Where’s your home?” asked Jing.\n\nA-Xia replied, “It’s not far away.”\n\nWhen morning came, she left. That night, when she did indeed return, they were happy and quite sincerely in love. Several more days went by, and A-Xia said to Jing, “Though our love is a beautiful thing, we’re still engaging in an illicit affair. My father is an official at the western border; tomorrow I’m going with my mother to see him, and when I get there I’ll take advantage of the opportunity to explain our situation to him, so he can approve of us spending the rest of our days together.”\n\n“How long will we be apart?” asked Jing. She figured it would be about ten days.\n\nOnce she left, Jing decided that his studio wouldn’t work as a permanent place for him to live with A-Xia; but if he moved their quarters to one of the inner rooms, he was certain his wife would be jealous. He concluded that it’d be better if he simply drove his wife away. With his mind made up, he began scolding and belittling her all the time. His wife couldn’t bear this humiliation and tearfully declared she wanted to kill herself.\n\n“I’m afraid your dying would make me look bad,” Jing commented, “so please just go back to your parents as soon as possible.” Then he urged her to go away.\n\nBetween sobs, his wife cried, “We’ve been married for ten years, and I’ve never done anything wrong, so how can you tear us apart like this!” Jing refused to listen and worked even harder to drive her away. His wife finally walked out the door and left. Jing whitewashed the walls and dusted his house, eagerly looking forward to A-Xia’s return; but he heard nothing from her, as though she’d vanished like a stone that’s sunk to the bottom of the sea.\n\nAfter his wife returned for good to her parents’ home, she asked several of her husband’s close friends to convey her request that Jing take her back again, but he wouldn’t hear of it; so instead she married a man named Xiahou. Xiahou lived on land adjacent to Jing’s, and the proximity of their properties had been the source of conflict between their families for generations.\n\nWhen Jing heard about the marriage, he became incredibly angry. Yet he consoled himself with the hope that A-Xia would return to him. Though it had been over a year, there had been no signs of her anywhere.\n\nOn the occasion of the sea god’s birthday, crowds of men and women gathered at the local temple, with Jing among them. In the distance he spotted a woman who looked very much like A-Xia. Jing hurried towards her, but she slipped into the crowd of people; while he was following her, she went out through the temple gate. He kept up his pursuit, but she just floated away from him and finally vanished. Jing continued chasing after her, but couldn’t catch up, and in angry frustration returned home.\n\nHalf a year later, Jing was walking along a road when he saw a young woman—dressed in red and being followed by a servant—who was riding on a black donkey. He looked closely and could tell that it was A-Xia. Hence he asked the servant, “Who is that young lady?”\n\n“She’s young Master Zheng’s new wife in Nancun,” he explained.\n\n“How long has she been married to him?” Jing demanded.\n\n“For six months now,” replied the servant. Jing thought this through, asking him whether he could be mistaken. When the young woman heard his question, she turned her eyes towards him with a glance that confirmed for Jing it truly was A-Xia.\n\nOnce he comprehended that she’d actually married Zheng, he was filled with rage and cried, “A-Xia! How could you have forgotten about me?” The servant heard his mistress cry out, and wanted to tear into Jing with his fists. A-Xia quickly prevented him from doing so.\n\nShe lifted up her silk veil and exclaimed, “You faithless man, how can you even face me?”\n\n“It’s you who betrayed me,” said Jing. “When have I ever betrayed you?”\n\nA-Xia replied, “Betraying your first wife was worse than betraying me! If you treat your first wife so badly, how will you treat any others? Because your ancestors were virtuous and generous, your name was listed in the records of those who would pass the imperial civil service examination, and for that reason, I said I would marry you; now that you’ve abandoned your wife, your official rank and salary has been cut from the records in the underworld, and the name of another second-place candidate, Wang Chang, has been substituted for your own. I’ve already been welcomed into the Zheng home, so I don’t want you to waste any further thoughts on me.”\n\nJing’s head bowed in abject submission, and he couldn’t find any words to say. Seeing this, A-Xia whipped her mount and sped away, leaving Jing behind, melancholy and shamed.\n\nHer pronouncement came to pass, and Jing failed the imperial civil service examination, while the second place candidate proved to be a fellow named Wang Chang. A-Xia’s husband, Zheng, was also a successful candidate.\n\nJing subsequently became notorious for his disloyalty. Forty years old and unmarried, his household in decline, he deliberately visited his relatives and friends at mealtimes in order to scrounge some food from them. Once he came across to Zheng’s home for this reason, so Zheng fed him and offered to give him a place to stay for the night.\n\nA-Xia stole a peek at the guest, saw that it was Jing, and took pity on him, asking Zheng, “That guest in the hall, isn’t that Jing Qingyun?” When he asked how she knew him, A-Xia explained, “Before I married you, he helped me avoid disaster by inviting me into his home and taking care of me. Although his conduct after that was despicable, his ancestors’ good works shouldn’t be ignored; besides, he’s a friend of yours, so it’s only fair and proper that you give him something for old times’ sake.” Zheng, approving of this, replaced Jing’s worn out clothing, and invited him to stay on for a few more days.\n\nOne evening, when Jing was about to go to sleep, a female servant came in carrying over twenty taels as a gift for him. From outside his window, the voice of A-Xia explained, “This is from my personal savings, just to reward your previous kindness, so you can take it and go find a good wife. You’re fortunate enough to have had ancestors who were virtuous and generous, and their good fortune is still sufficiently abundant to transfer to their descendants. Never again behave despicably, and you may yet live out all your remaining years.” Jing expressed his gratitude to her.\n\nThen he went home, and with about ten taels, he bought the maid from a retired official’s household, a woman who was ugly and combative. They had a son, and in time he became a successful candidate in the county and provincial levels of the civil service examination. Master Zheng became an official in the Ministry of Personnel. When he died, A-Xia took part in the funeral procession that carried him home to be buried, and when people looked inside her carriage but found no one there, they finally realized that she wasn’t human.\n\nAlas! When a man is unprincipled, abandoning what he formerly valued while scheming for something new, in the end all is lost, and heaven’s reply is pitiless!",

        "body": "Ma Tianrong, the son of a peasant family, was over twenty years old. Though a widower, he was too poor to remarry. It happened one day, while he was out weeding in the field, that he saw a young woman wearing beautiful make-up walk past him on one of the paths between fields, her rosy appearance making her seem both charming and refined. Ma figured that she must have lost her way, and when he turned to look around, there was no one else around besides the young woman, so he came closer to flirt with her. She seemed to be waiting there submissively for him.\n\nMa wanted to make love to her. She laughed and said, “On such a fine day, there’s undoubtedly something better to do than this. If you go home, shut your gate and wait for me, this evening I’ll join you there.” Ma didn’t believe her, so the young woman swore to him that she would come. Ma therefore gave her detailed directions to his place, and then she went her own way.\n\nAt midnight, she did indeed arrive, and they made love enthusiastically. When he touched her flesh, it felt extremely delicate; he held a candle to get a better look at it, and the skin was as pink and soft as a baby’s, with fine hairs all over her body, which seemed pretty strange.\n\nHe became suspicious and began thinking to himself, couldn’t she be a fox? Then he playfully asked her about it. The young woman admitted the truth, concealing nothing.\n\n“Since you’re an immortal,” Ma remarked, “you can get anything you want. Now that you’ve already come here and made love with me, won’t you offer me some money, to help me out of my poverty?” The young woman agreed to do so.\n\nWhen she came the next night, Ma asked her for the money. She looked surprised and exclaimed, “I must have forgotten.” Just as she was about to leave, Ma reminded her again about the matter.\n\nThe next night he asked her, “Do I need to beg again, or did you remember this time?” The young woman laughed, and asked him to wait till some other day.\n\nSeveral days went by, and Ma once again made his request. The young woman laughed, turned and took two silver ingots from her sleeve, about five or six taels in value, and when he held them up so he could see their fine-grained edges, he found them extremely lovely. Ma was very pleased and hid them away in a case.\n\nSix months elapsed, and it happened that he needed some money, so he took a bar out and showed it to a man. The fellow told Ma, “This is tin.” He took it and bit into it, then after he’d tested it with his mouth, it broke apart. Ma was utterly astonished, took the bar back and went home.\n\nThat night when the young fox woman showed up, he berated her angrily. She laughed, and said, “It’s just your poor fortune that you can’t afford to have real gold.” She laughed once more.\n\nMa replied, “I’ve heard that fox spirits are all incredible beauties, but that doesn’t seem to be the case with you.”\n\n“We look just the same as people when we adopt their appearance as our disguises,” she explained. “But your fortune is too weak to have even a single silver tael to your credit, so how can you suppose yourself capable of possessing an extraordinarily beautiful woman? I may be stupid and uncultured, and indeed I may not be worthy of acceptance into the highest levels of society, but compared to someone with big feet and a hunchback, I’m an incredible beauty.”\n\nSeveral months passed, when suddenly one day she gave Ma three silver taels as a gift, explaining, “You’ve repeatedly begged this of me and I refused before because of your poor fortune. Now that your engagement is not far off, please use this money I’ve given you as a parting gift to pay for a wife.”\n\nMa explained that he wasn’t planning to marry a woman. The young woman responded, “In one or two days, a matchmaker will come here.”\n\n“What will the prospective wife look like?” he asked.\n\n“You’ve been thinking about incredible beauties,” she said, “so no doubt she’ll be extremely attractive.”\n\nMa commented, “I dare not hope for that. For three taels, how can I possibly buy that kind of wife?”\n\n“The god of matchmakers,” she replied, “has already decided this is your fate. It’s not controlled by human beings.”\n\nMa asked, “But why do you want to say goodbye to me and leave?”\n\n“I’ve come here at night and left at dawn,” she answered, “but this couldn’t be a permanent relationship for us. ‘For a gentleman to have a wife’—is there any reason for you to resist that expectation?” The next morning, before she left, she gave him a yellow medicinal powder and said, “You might become sick after we’ve parted, but a dose of this will cure you.”\n\nThe next day, a go-between did indeed come. First Ma asked her what the girl she represented looked like, to which she replied, “There’s a touch of both the beautiful and the ugly.”\n\n“How much money must I give for the betrothal?” he asked her.\n\n“About four or five taels, I figure.”\n\nMa didn’t argue with the price, but he insisted on being able to see the young woman himself. The matchmaker warned him that a respectable family would never agree to put their daughter on display. Later on, she agreed to have him come along so he might find an opportunity to take a look at her for himself.\n\nWhen they arrived at the girl’s village, the matchmaker went on ahead and left Ma to wait just outside the village. After quite a while, she returned and said, “We’ve come to an agreement. My cousins live where she does, and just now I went in and saw her sitting in the middle of the room. Please act like you’ve come to pay my cousins a visit, and then when you pass by, you can sneak a close look at the girl.”\n\nMa followed her advice. As a result, he saw the girl from the hallway, laying on her bed, asking for someone to scratch her back. Ma quickly passed by, sweeping his eyes over her, and her looks were truly like something out of poetry.\n\nWhen it was time to discuss the betrothal, the girl’s family didn’t argue for a higher price, but sought to obtain just one or two silver taels for her, so they could have the girl dressed and brought out of her chamber. Ma thought the price a cheap one and gave them the amount they asked for; he also gave the matchmaker and the man composing the marriage announcement some money, altogether spending three taels, well within the amount the fox had suggested.\n\nHe brought the girl home on the day chosen as auspicious for the occasion, but as she entered his gate, she became hunchbacked, her neck shrank up like a turtle’s, and he saw huge feet stick out from underneath her skirt. Then he realized that this was what the fox woman’s words had meant.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Perhaps claiming that she had simply adopted the appearance of an ordinary person without carefully picking her disguise was just the lady fox’s excuse to avoid embarrassment; however, her explanation about Ma’s fortune is what I believe most firmly. I often say that if our ancestors hadn’t worked for generations to improve themselves, their descendants couldn’t have become successful high officials; if not for one’s prior generations working to improve themselves, one could never afford a beautiful wife. If you’re someone who believes that whatever happens is a matter of cause-and-effect, you certainly won’t find my words just empty chatter.”",

        "body": "Luo Zifu lived in Bin prefecture. His father and mother both died prematurely. When he was only eight or nine years old, he had to depend on his uncle, Luo Daye, to take care of him. That uncle was a wealthy senior official, but he had no son, so he loved Zifu as if he was his very own.\n\nWhen Zifu was fourteen, he fell under the seductive influence of some shady individuals and became a patron of brothels. There happened then to be a prostitute from Nanjing living in Bin prefecture with whom young Luo became utterly infatuated. When she returned to Nanjing, Zifu furtively ran after her.\n\nLiving in the brothel with her for half a year, he exhausted all of his financial resources, and hence was greatly scorned by all the junior and senior prostitutes there. Even then he was in no hurry to break things off with the girl. Before long, his syphilis sores began to fester and stink, infecting his bed and mattress, so he was thrown out of the brothel.\n\nHe began to beg in the marketplace and the townspeople always made sure to avoid him when they noticed him. He became scared that he might end up dying far from his home, so he began moving westward as he begged; each day he’d travel thirty or forty _li_, till eventually he arrived at the border of Bin prefecture. Then he thought about what a worthless, pustulent abomination he was, and couldn’t face the prospect of entering the gate of his hometown, so he turned around and wandered into a neighboring village.\n\nAs daylight turned to dusk, he hurried toward a mountain monastery for the night. On his way, he met a young woman who had a face like a goddess. As she drew close, she asked, “Why are you here?” Luo told her the truth. “I’m a holy recluse,” she replied, “and I live in a cave here, where you can stay so you don’t have to worry about wild animals.” Zifu was relieved and went with her.\n\nWhen they entered the cave, deep inside the mountain, he saw that it was indeed the abode of a recluse. He walked through an opening and there was a mountain brook with a stone bridge over it. Then several steps further, there were two rooms of stone that were entirely illuminated, so there was no need for lamps or candles there. The woman told Luo Zifu to take off his tattered clothing, so he could bathe in the brook. “Washing will help your sores to heal,” she explained.\n\nAfterwards she opened out a blanket and shook the dust off a mat for him, urging him to get some rest: “Please feel free to fall asleep while I make you some new clothes.” Then she took what looked like a large banana leaf, and with scissors cut and sewed him some clothes. Lying there, Zifu observed all this. In a short time she finished, folded them, and set them next to his mat, saying, “Tomorrow you can wear these.” Then she went straight to her own bed to sleep.\n\nAfter Luo had bathed, his sores no longer hurt him. When he woke up, he ran his finger over them and found that thick scabs had formed there. Now that it was morning and he was about to head off, he began to wonder how he could possibly wear a banana leaf. He took a careful look at it, and found it to be perfectly smooth green brocade.\n\nA bit later, it was time for them to eat together. The woman took some leaves and called them cakes, and when he ate them, Zifu found they really were cakes; when she cut some leaves into chicken and fish shapes with her scissors and then cooked them, they all ended up as the real things. In one corner of the room, there was a small jar with good wine in it, and they drank from it regularly; whenever its level got low, they simply took some of the brook water and filled it back up.\n\nAfter several days, the scabs over his sores were completely gone, and immediately Luo wanted to sleep with her. The woman cried, “You silly boy! Your body’s barely healed, yet you have such bold thoughts!”\n\n“I only want to repay your kindness,” he replied. So they went to bed together, and were very happy in their love.\n\nOne day a young woman entered the cave with a laugh and cried, “Pianpian, you little imp, you must be so happy! Oh well, destiny brings lovers together—so when did you get married?”\n\nPianpian welcomed her with a laugh of her own, and retorted, “Huacheng, you haven’t set foot here in such a long time, a southwest wind must’ve been blowing today to drive you here! Have you had a baby boy?”\n\n“A baby girl,” Huacheng replied.\n\nPianpian giggled and declared, “You’re producing only girls! Why not bring her here?”\n\n“There’d be a racket then,” Huacheng explained, “since she’s sleeping now.” So they sat and entertained themselves with some wine. Then Huacheng turned to Luo and said, “Young sir, you must have burnt some incense for good luck.” Luo looked her over, and figured her for twenty-three or twenty-four, graceful, and with beauty to spare. He found her quite attractive.\n\nWhile he was peeling a fruit, it accidentally fell off the table, and when he bent down to pick it up, he took advantage of the situation to hold and stroke her foot. Huacheng turned around, but acted as though she wasn’t aware anything had happened. Zifu then became dazed and confused, and suddenly felt cold where his robe and pants were; he looked at his clothes and saw that they’d turned to dead leaves. This nearly scared him to death. He sat up uncomfortably for a little while, until the leaves gradually became clothes as they were before. He secretly acknowledged his good fortune that the two women hadn’t noticed what had happened.\n\nIn a short while, they were exchanging toasts and again he took advantage of the situation to stroke Huacheng’s palm lightly; she calmly laughed and chatted with Pianpian, as though she wasn’t aware he’d done anything. Suddenly Luo’s heart began to race and palpitate, his clothes turned once more to leaves, then after a bit changed back again. Because of this, Luo was shamed into stopping his inappropriate behavior, no longer daring to indulge his fantasies about Huacheng.\n\nShe smiled and exclaimed, “Your gentleman husband is certainly no good! If you hadn’t ridiculed him, I fear he would’ve quickly gotten into trouble.”\n\nPianpian also smiled and said, “This insensitive fellow deserves to freeze to death!” Together the women applauded the idea.\n\nHuacheng got up from her seat and said, “My little girl’s waking up. I’m afraid she’s crying quite a bit.”\n\nPianpian also stood up and replied, “You were so obsessed with seducing someone else’s man, you didn’t remember that your little one might be sobbing for you.” Once Huacheng left, Luo was afraid that Pianpian was going to berate him for his behavior; instead, she dealt with him just as she would have ordinarily.\n\nSoon afterwards, when autumn arrived with its accustomed wind and cold, and frost caused the trees to shed their leaves, Pianpian collected the fallen leaves, storing them to stave off the cold during the winter. She noticed that Luo was shivering, so she took a cloak, and from the entrance to the cave she collected a white cloud and stuffed it into the Luo’s clothing, so when he wore it, it felt as warm as a quilt, and in addition it always remained light and soft like it was made of new cotton.\n\nWhen a year had passed, a son who was bright and handsome was born to Luo and Pianpian. Every day Luo and Pianpian played happily with the boy in the cave. However, Luo kept thinking about his hometown, so he begged Pianpian to go there with him. She told him, “I can’t go with you; since that’s the case, you should just go by yourself.” Hence he stayed there two or three more years while their son gradually grew up, and drafted an agreement with Huacheng for the boy eventually to marry her daughter.\n\nLuo kept thinking about his elderly uncle. Pianpian remarked, “Though your uncle is now an aged man, fortunately he’s very strong and healthy, so don’t trouble yourself with worrying about him. Wait until we’ve seen our son married and then you can go if you wish.”\n\nBack in the cave, Pianpian always used leaves as books to write in while she taught her son to read, and he understood everything he saw. “This boy has a face that promises good fortune,” she declared, “and if he’s allowed to enter the mortal realm, there’s no doubt he’ll become a cabinet minister.”\n\nNot many years later, the son turned fourteen. Huacheng consequently brought her daughter to them. The girl arrived wearing festive clothing, her face glowing with happiness. Luo and Pianpian were absolutely delighted and the whole family gathered together for a banquet. Pianpian removed a hairpin and tapped it on the table, then said, “We have a fine son, so we don’t envy the wealthy officials. We have a fine daughter-in-law, so we don’t envy those who wear elegant silk. Tonight we’re gathered together and everyone’s happy. Drink up, and please eat your fill.”\n\nAfterward, Huacheng went home. Luo and Pianpian gave their son and his bride the room opposite theirs. The new bride was a filial daughter, and was as affectionate to her in-laws as if they were her own parents.\n\nLuo again told Pianpian that he wanted to go home. She replied, “You’re fated to remain mortal and never become an immortal. Our son will also experience the wealth and honor of an ordinary man, so if you take him and leave, I won’t interfere.” By the time the new bride was ready to take her leave of her own mother, Huacheng had already arrived.\n\nThe son and daughter clung to their mothers, as tears filled everyone’s eyes. The two mothers consoled their children, “You’re only going away for a little while, then you can come back.” Pianpian then took scissors, trimmed some leaves into donkeys, and told the three of them to climb aboard for the ride home.\n\nLuo Daye was old enough that he had retired from official life by then, and believed that his nephew must be dead, so when Zifu suddenly returned home, bringing a fine grandson and his beautiful wife, the old man was as overjoyed as if he’d just been given precious gems. Once they entered his gate, they all watched as their clothes turned back to banana leaves; when they cut into them, the cotton wadding inside turned back to clouds and floated away. Then they changed into other clothes.\n\nLater on, Luo began to think about Pianpian, so he took his son with him to find her, but all they found were dead leaves covering the pathway, and there was no longer a cave entrance to be found, so they returned, empty-handed and in tears.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Pianpian and Huacheng were immortals, weren’t they? Eating leaves, making clothes from clouds—how extraordinary! However, Pianpian laughed and talked with Luo like they were a couple in the bedroom where they slept and made love together, and then Pianpian gave birth to a child, so in what sense was she any different from anyone else in the mortal world? Luo Zifu lived in the mountains for fifteen years, though he then returned to the mortal world, which hadn’t changed much; and all he could see when he returned were clouds obscuring the cave entrance and no traces of what he was looking for, which is just like in ancient times when Liu and Ruan returned with their stories.”",

As he looked down at the mountainside below, he spotted a tiger, coming up with something in its mouth, proceed to dig a hole in the ground with its claws, bury the thing, and then leave.\n\n“The man sent one of his servants to find out what was buried in the spot and it turned out to be a dead deer. Then they dug up the deer and smoothed the ground over the hole, as if it hadn’t been touched.\n\n“After a little while, the tiger led a black beast, with fur several _cun_ long, to the site. The tiger walked ahead of the beast as though guiding a distinguished guest. When they arrived at the cache, the beast crouched in wait, eyeing the site greedily. When the tiger pawed through the dirt and found the deer missing, it laid down submissively, trembling, not daring to move a muscle.\n\n“The beast, angry at being disappointed, struck the tiger in the head with its claws, killing it instantly. The beast then sauntered off on its way.”\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Nobody knew what kind of beast it was. However, people asked about its size and shape, and wondered, since it wasn’t any bigger than the tiger, why the tiger just stuck out its neck to be killed—what could’ve caused it to be so frightened? Everything in existence is subject to the mastery of something else, for reasons that cannot be explained.\n\n“It’s like brown monkeys being absolutely terrified of golden monkeys; if they see one in the distance, tens or even hundreds of them will gather together, line up in a kneeling position, and make no attempt to escape. They’ll stare, holding their breath as they hear the golden monkey coming, its claws out, ready to separate the fat monkeys from the thin ones; the fat ones will even place a bit of stone of top of their heads to mark themselves. The brown monkeys put the stones on their heads and then prostrate themselves, paralyzed by fear, and succumb to their terror. The golden monkey notices the stone signs and stops at them, then one after another he takes off the stones and selects those monkeys to eat, while the others noisily scatter.\n\n“I know it’s been said that greedy minor officials are like the golden monkeys and scrutinize people to distinguish the rich and the poor, then mark them, tear into them, and devour them; and though others should be able to hear when someone else is being eaten, they don’t dare make a sound, for people are afraid of greedy officials just as the brown monkeys are terrified by the golden ones. What a pity that there are such persons!”",

        "body": "Yin Tunan of Wuchang owned a second house on his property that had once been leased by a scholar. Half a year had elapsed, and he hadn’t gone over to check on it, nor in that time had he inquired about the scholar. One day, they ran into each other at Yin’s gate, where he noticed that the scholar appeared to be well to do, both refined and handsome. Yin hurried over to speak with him, and indeed found him cultured and attractive. He felt rather surprised about this.\n\nWhen he went back inside his own house, he told his wife about it. She sent a maid to snoop around in his house on the pretext of sending some gifts from Yin to the scholar. In the house, the maid discovered a gorgeous woman who was more alluring than a goddess; moreover, none of the flowers, unusual stones, clothing, and rare curios that she observed were like anything one might expect to see in such a place.\n\nYin couldn’t deduce anything about the scholar’s background, so he decided to pay him a visit, but arrived just after the scholar had stepped out. The next day, the scholar arrived to return the courtesy. Yin opened up his calling card, and discovered his name to be Yu De.\n\nWhile speaking with him, Yin inquired delicately about Yu’s official titles and family, but received very vague answers. He pressed his inquiries and was told, “Since you want us to continue as friends, I wouldn’t dream of dodging your questions. You can tell that I’m not some kind of bandit on the run, so I don’t see why it’s necessary for you to insist on knowing about my background.” Yin apologized to him.\n\nHe called for wine and food to entertain them while they merrily laughed and chatted. Towards sunset, some servants arrived with horses, carrying lanterns, to accompany Yu home, and so he left.\n\nThe next day, Yu De sent a letter returning the favor, offering to serve as Yin’s host. Yin went over to his house, and saw that the rooms’ walls were all covered with a shiny paper that gleamed like mirrors. There was a golden lion incense burner, and inside it smoldered some rare, fragrant incense. Inserted into a green jade bottle were two tail feathers from a phoenix, and two from a peacock, each more than two _chi_ long.\n\nHe noticed a small tree with pink flowers that had been placed in a crystal vase, but he had no idea what it was called, and it was also about two _chi_ long, its branches drooping so far over the sides that they seemed almost ready to tip over the vase; there were few leaves on the tree, but the flowers were abundant without having blossomed yet; the flowers’ shapes were like butterflies, with their wings folded back by dew; the stems were as fine as hairs.\n\nThe banquet consisted of no more than eight dishes, but each of them was sumptuous and extraordinary.\n\nLater, Yu ordered a boy servant to pound a drum, using the beat to accompany their drinking. The vibrations from the drum’s pounding made the flowers in the vase vibrate and shake like they might pop into blossom, till presently the butterfly-wing leaves started to open up; once the drumming stopped, there was a deep sound, and a fine flower stem suddenly fell out of the vase, turned into a butterfly, and landed on Yin’s clothing.\n\nYu laughed and stood up, pouring wine into a huge vessel for Yin; when it was filled nearly to the brim, the butterfly flew away. A moment later, the drum was beaten once again, and two more butterflies flew up and landed on Yu’s cap. Yu laughed and exclaimed, “My own magic’s backfired on me.” He also drank two more cups of wine\n\nWhen the third round of pounding drums finished, the flowers fell out of the vase, randomly dropping to the floor and getting all over their clothes. The boy who’d been drumming smiled, and did a tally of the flowery butterflies on each: Yin consequently had to take nine drinks for his, and Yu had to have four drinks. Yin had already become rather drunk, and simply couldn’t handle nine more vessels of wine, so after managing to drink three more, he left the banquet and fled for home. This led him to think of Yu De as even more remarkable.\n\nHowever, Yu De was a private person, always keeping the gate to his home shut, and didn’t participate even when his neighbors were in mourning or celebrating. Yin described their encounter whenever he ran into someone; when they heard about his incredible experience, they hurried to make friends with Yu, and officials often gathered outside his gate to catch a glimpse of him. Yu couldn’t stand all the attention, so he abruptly took his leave of his landlord Yin and departed.\n\nOnce he was gone and Yin entered the house Yu had leased from him, he found the courtyard empty, and even the finest dust had been swept away; used candles had been tossed in piles underneath the dark stone steps; the torn threads of the silk curtains hanging in the windows seemed to retain the impressions of Yu’s fingers. In searching the house, Yin also found a small, pale stone crock, that could hold several stones.\n\nHe carried it home and filled it with water, so he could raise some decorative fish in it. A year went by, and yet the water in it was just as clear as when he had first poured it in. Later on, there was a servant who was trying to move the crock, and accidentally broke it. The water inside remained standing there, without splashing away in a flood. It looked just like the crock was still there, until one reached out, and in the absence of the crock, could actually feel the water. Whenever a hand was inserted into it, water would leak out along the hand; when it was withdrawn, the water would resume its original form. Even during the eleventh month of the lunar year, it wouldn’t freeze over.\n\nOne night, the water suddenly turned into crystal, though the fish continued to swim around as before. Yin was afraid that people might find out about it, so he put it in a secret room, and no one but his son and son-in-law were allowed to know of it. Over time, however, word gradually leaked out, and people demanded to be able to see it, noisily crowding together at Yin’s gate.\n\nDuring the twelfth lunar month, the block suddenly turned back into water, getting everything cold and wet as it soaked the floor, and the fish disappeared. The shards of the old crock were all that remained.\n\nJust then, a Daoist priest called at the house and asked to see the crock. Yin brought it out and showed its remains to him. The Daoist declared, “This was used for storage in the underwater Palace of the Dragon King.” Yin told him about the crock being broken, and the water not running out. “That’s because this crock still retains its spirit,” explained the Daoist.\n\nHe courteously asked to be given a tiny piece of it. Yin asked him what he would use it for, and the Daoist replied, “I’ll take pulverized bits of it to mix with medicinal herbs, so it can make me immortal.” Once Yin gave him a sliver, the Daoist joyfully thanked him and departed.",

        "body": "Scholar Cheng, who lived in Baixia, was upright in character and didn’t feel obliged to regulate his behavior according to social customs and manners. One day as he was outside upon returning home, he loosened his belt in anticipation of changing his clothes, but it suddenly felt as though the belt had become so heavy that it might fall to the ground. He examined it, but there wasn’t anything to see.\n\nThen he discovered that a young woman had come up behind him, for she flashed a tiny smile at him as she swept her hair back, looking extremely beautiful. Just as Cheng was wondering whether she might be a ghost, the girl declared, “I’m not a ghost, I’m a fox.”\n\n“If I could have such a beauty,” said Cheng, “I wouldn’t be afraid to accept her, even if she was a ghost—and even less afraid if she were a fox.” Then he made love to her.\n\nTwo years later, she gave birth to a baby daughter whom she nicknamed Qingmei. She often told Cheng, “If you don’t marry, I’ll bear you a son.” Cheng believed her and didn’t marry. But his relatives and friends berated and mocked him for this. Cheng gave in to their pressure and became engaged to a woman from the Wang family in Hudong.\n\nThe fox became furious when she heard about it, so when she came to breast-feed their daughter, she told Cheng, “This little girl’s just a waste of money to your family. To raise her or to kill her is up to you. Why should I feed her for some other woman!” Then she stormed out.\n\nAs Qingmei grew, she proved to be quite intelligent; she also became a real beauty, closely resembling her mother. Later on, when Cheng grew ill and died, the Wang woman remarried and went away. Qingmei was sent to live with her uncle; he was a vile man who wanted to sell her to make himself rich.\n\nIt just so happened that another scholar, named Wang—who had become a successful candidate in the highest imperial examination, and was waiting at home to be assigned his official post—had heard about Qingmei’s intellect, so he paid a huge sum of money for her and made her a servant girl for his daughter, Xi, at home. Xi was fourteen and a peerless beauty.\n\nWhen she saw Qingmei, she was overjoyed with her, and they lived together in the same room. Qingmei was also adept at serving Xi, as though she could hear others’ thoughts just by looking at them, and could communicate back with her eyebrows, so the whole family grew to love her.\n\nIn the town, there was a scholar named Zhang Jieshou. His family, which was very poor and didn’t own any land, rented a place to live from Wang, the official. By nature Zhang was well-informed and filial, self-restrained and conscientious, and also quite earnest in his studies.\n\nQingmei happened to visit his place, and spotted him sitting on a stone, eating rice gruel; she entered the room, and as she proceeded to chat pleasantly with his mother, Qingmei noticed a dish of pig’s trotters had been prepared and set on the table there.\n\nAt that time, Zhang’s father was laid up ill in bed, and Qingmei watched as Zhang went in and held him so he could relieve himself. Just as the father’s urine had begun to stain Zhang’s clothing, the father noticed it and felt ashamed that he couldn’t help himself; but Zhang simply hid all traces of it and quickly went outside to wash his filthy clothes, hoping his father wouldn’t realize what had actually happened. Qingmei thought this behavior very rare.\n\nShe went home and described what she’d seen, telling Xi, “Our renter is an extraordinary man. If you don’t want a good husband, then just let him slip away; but if you want to make a good match, this scholar Zhang is just the person.” Xi was worried that her father would disapprove of his poverty. Qingmei replied, “Not at all, since everything will be decided by your own efforts. If you’re willing to accept him, I’ll privately go out and ask for him to send a marriage broker to us. Then Mrs. Wang must call on you, so you can discuss the matter, and you only need to say, ‘I consent,’ and we’ll conclude the matter harmoniously.”\n\nXi was afraid that everyone who knew her would tease her for marrying a poor man. Qingmei assured her, “I can tell someone’s future from his complexion, and there’s no mistake about him, for sure.”\n\nThe next day, Qingmei went to speak with Zhang’s mother. The old woman was quite shocked, and said that Qingmei’s suggestion was inauspicious. “The young lady has heard of your son and his virtues,” Qingmei answered her, “so accordingly I sensed her intentions and came here to tell you. If a matchmaker comes to our family, I’m sure that the two of us can settle any disputes and then make this proposal acceptable. Even if you’re refused, how could that possibly bring any humiliation to your son?”\n\n“Very well,” the old woman said. Then they secured a go-between named Hou, who sold flowers for a living, to go and deliver the proposal to the official.\n\nWang’s wife heard the proposal and just laughed, then told Wang about it. He also found the proposal hilarious. They summoned their daughter, and when she arrived, they told her about the proposal.\n\nXi couldn’t manage a reply, so Qingmei earnestly praised the young man for his virtuousness as someone most certainly to be valued highly. Wang’s wife asked Xi’s opinion directly, remarking, “This business involves your whole life. If you can stand to become completely destitute, then we will accept this for you.”\n\nXi kept her head bowed for a long time, then turned towards the wall and replied, “One’s economic condition is a matter of fate. As long as one’s fated to become wealthy, poverty will only be temporary; one’s life beyond poverty will be ever so much longer. If one’s fate is flawed, though he or she is as splendid as a child of nobility, what can be done but to become one of the throng of people too poor to support themselves? But I’ll listen to your decision.”\n\nOriginally, Wang’s intention in discussing it with Xi had been to make her laugh at the notion; but when he heard her words, he grew unhappy and asked her, “Do you really think it’s appropriate for you to marry Zhang?” Xi gave no reply; he asked her again, and again she had nothing to say.\n\nAngered, Wang exclaimed, “You cheap thing, you’ll never get ahead! You just want to be a beggar’s wife, carrying a begging basket without feeling shamed to death!” Devastated, Xi turned red, holding back her tears as she left. The matchmaker also took the opportunity to hurry away.\n\nWhen Qingmei saw that there would be no agreement among them, she decided to marry herself to Zhang. When several days had passed, she paid a visit to Zhang one night. He was reading at the time, and in his surprise, he demanded of Qingmei why she’d come; she answered him hesitantly, hemming and hawing. Zhang thought she was trying to seduce him, so he rejected her.\n\nQingmei sobbed, “I’m a good woman, not someone immoral; I came to propose for myself because of your reputation for virtue, in hopes that you might be able to accept me.”\n\n“You’re fond of me,” Zhang replied, “and you say that I’m virtuous. Your coming here in the dark of night is not what a good person would do, so how could a virtuous man agree to it? If I begin immorally, I’ll have an immoral ending, which is definitely not what a gentleman should desire; furthermore, if we were unable to make a match, how could we possibly face each other afterwards?”\n\nQingmei answered, “If it could even possibly succeed, would you finally agree to accept me?”\n\n“If I could have a wife like you, how could I ask for anyone else?” Zhang questioned. “But there are three situations that we must address or give up on the possibility.”\n\n“Then what are they?” she wondered.\n\nHe explained, “If I can’t decide by myself to agree, the matter must be abandoned; if my parents aren’t happy about it, we have to give it up; and even if they _are_ happy with the idea, if your marriage proposal requires money that I cannot afford, then once again we would have to give up on it. Please leave quickly now, before someone suspects you and me of being involved in something inappropriate!”\n\nQingmei was about to leave, but pressed once again, and said, “If you’d be so kind, I’d like to ask you to plan this together with me.” He agreed to do so.\n\nQingmei went home, and when Xi asked her how it had gone, Qingmei went down on her knees and confessed everything. Xi was angry at Qingmei’s behavior and her inappropriate visit to Zhang, and was about to strike her in blame. Qingmei wept openly, because the situation was not what Xi thought, and she’d told Xi the truth.\n\nXi then sighed in understanding, and exclaimed, “There was no illicit sex, so that shows his moral integrity; he’ll certainly tell his father and mother, being a filial son; and there were no rash promises, so he’ll keep his word—these three moral acts surely mean that heaven is watching over him, so he won’t always be afflicted by poverty.” Then she asked, “What will you do, then?”\n\n“Marry him,” replied Qingmei.\n\nXi laughed sadly and said, “Fool, how can a maidservant make her own decision?”\n\n“If I fail,” said Qingmei, “then I shall take my own life.”\n\nXi replied, “I’ll certainly do everything I can to help you realize your wish.” Qingmei kowtowed abjectly, to show the degree of her respect for Xi.\n\nAfter several days, she inquired of Xi, “Were you only joking before, or will you really take pity on me and help me? If so, then there’s something more I would like to ask of you.”\n\nXi asked her what she meant, and she replied, “Scholar Zhang is unable to make a marriage offer, and as a maidservant, I’m also powerless to arrange my own betrothal, while surely the master will want to sell me and make some good money—so your wish to help me marry seems like just a dream after all.”\n\nXi sat deep in thought and then said, “That’s precisely what I can’t do anything about. If I said, ‘I’m going to authorize your marriage,’ I’m afraid that would be inappropriate; and if I said that you can have your freedom without paying us for it, my father would certainly not agree to it—besides the fact that I wouldn’t even dare to suggest it.” Qingmei listened, weeping copiously, praying to receive sympathy and help from Xi.\n\nXi sat thinking for a good long time before declaring, “Though I don’t have other solutions, I have several taels in personal savings, so I’ll give them all to you to help you.” Qingmei thanked her formally, then secretly left to inform Zhang. Zhang’s mother was very pleased, and did everything she could to beg for a loan, so they put together the money they had, and then hid it to wait for good news.\n\nMeanwhile, Wang received a ministerial appointment in Quwo county, so Xi seized the chance to explain things to her mother, saying, “Qingmei has already grown up, so now that my father’s about to take up a new position, it would be best for us to send her away.”\n\nWang’s wife had always disliked Qingmei because she was too full of ideas that might lead Xi astray, and she’d found herself withholding her suggestions of who Xi should marry, for fear that Xi wouldn’t agree to it. Thus she was very happy to hear Xi’s suggestion that Qingmei leave.\n\nAfter two days, a messenger was sent from the Zhang family to express their intentions. Wang smiled and explained, “He’s only qualified to ask to marry my maidservant—how ridiculous he was before, to propose to my daughter! However, if I could sell Qingmei to become the second wife in some rich family, I’d get more money for her.”\n\nXi stepped forward quickly and said, “Qingmei has looked out for me for a long time, and if you sell her to become someone’s second wife, I shall feel very sad.” Wang then sent word to the Zhang family, contracting for them to purchase Qingmei for the price he’d originally paid, and Qingmei was conveyed to Zhang’s home.\n\nOnce she entered his gate, Qingmei responded filially to her parents-in-law. and carried out her new duties compliantly, even more devotedly than Zhang himself; and she performed her manual labor more diligently than ever, satisfying herself on their humble meals without complaint. Hence everyone in Zhang’s family came to love and respect Qingmei very much.\n\nQingmei then took up embroidery, and her work began to sell quite briskly, so that merchants would wait outside the household’s gate to buy it, for fear that otherwise they might not have a chance to obtain any of it. With the money she earned from this, the family became less poor, and was able to live a little bit better. Then she persuaded Zhang not to abandon his studies simply in order to oversee the household, and she personally took over its management.\n\nBecause Wang was about to leave to take up his new post, she went to visit Xi and say farewell. When Xi saw her, she sobbed, “You’ve got what you wanted; I certainly can’t compare with you for dedication.”\n\nQingmei replied, “I won’t dare forget who helped me do this. If you think you’re not comparable to me, that very thought will destroy me.” Then they wept together.\n\nSix months after Wang left to take up his post, his wife died, and her coffin was placed in a temple. Two years later, Wang was dismissed from his post for having taken a bribe, and had to pay a large fine in silver, till he was finally bankrupted and couldn’t pay any more, so his followers fled from him.\n\nAbout that time, an epidemic broke out and Wang, having contracted the disease, also died. There was only one old woman left to look after Xi. Soon, the old woman also died. Xi’s suffering increased, now that she was entirely alone.\n\nThere was an elderly neighbor woman who advised her to marry, but Xi replied, “I will marry whomever is willing to bury my parents for me.” The old lady was sympathetic to her, and left her a large measure of rice before departing.\n\nHalf a month later, she returned and said, “I’m doing my best to help you, but the business is difficult to handle: The poor men can’t help you bury your parents, and the rich men complain that you come from a bankrupted family. What a problem! However, I have a plan for you now, but I worry that you won’t accept it.”\n\n“What is it?” asked Xi.\n\n“Around here,” the old lady told her, “there’s a Master Li, who’s hoping to find himself a concubine; once he sees your looks, he’ll offer you what you need for a full funeral, and certainly won’t stint on it.”\n\nXi began weeping loudly and cried, “Then I’ll have to become a concubine, despite being descended from an official’s family!” The old lady said nothing more and left. Xi could only afford a single meal each day, just enough for her to survive while waiting for the best marriage offer she might receive.\n\nThough she stayed at home for half a year, her value didn’t increase. One day the old lady arrived. Xi wept as she told her, “Being in financial straits like this, I’ve often wanted to commit suicide; yet I’m still passionately attached to my duty, and if I died, there’d be no one to take care of those two coffins. I’ve gone round and round about it, so what can I do but accept your suggestion? I’ve decided it would be best to follow whatever you advise.”\n\nHence the old lady conducted Master Li there, and from his first glance at her, he was amazed by her beauty. He immediately took out enough taels to pay for the funeral expenses, and the pair of coffins were properly interred.\n\nAfterwards, when everything had been carried out, Li took her home to meet his legal wife. Li’s wife was jealous and overbearing, so he didn’t mention his intention to make Xi his concubine, simply claiming that he’d purchased a maidservant. When the wife came close to look at Xi, she flew into a violent rage, beating her until she drove her away, and refused to let her enter the house again. Her hair disheveled, and in tears, Xi was left with nowhere to go.\n\nShe encountered an elderly nun who invited her to come live with her, and Xi followed her till they came to a Buddhist convent, where Xi offered to become a nun, too. The nun said she shouldn’t, explaining, “When I saw you, I could tell that you won’t be in dire straits for very long. It’s a plain life in the convent, but I can find you a place to stay here for now. When the time is right, you can decide to leave.”\n\nBefore long, young rogues from the city started arriving to spy Xi’s beauty for themselves, and began knocking constantly at the convent’s gate, flocking there to make their suggestive comments, but the nun couldn’t make them stop it. Xi, humiliated and weeping, just wanted to end it all.\n\nThe nun went to the Ministry of Civil Appointments to request that a certain official investigate the matter and condemn the actions of the young toughs, forcing them to control their behavior.\n\nAfterwards, somebody made a hole in a wall of the convent one evening, and the nun gave a warning cry, so the perpetrator ran off. Hence she returned to the Ministry of Civil Appointments, and when they arrested the principal culprits, delivering them to the prefectural headquarters to be flogged, Xi gradually began to feel safer.\n\nAnother year had gone by, when a wealthy official passing by the convent spotted Xi, and was stunned by her beauty, so he rushed into the convent, eagerly asked the nun to introduce him to her, and after that offered to make a substantial donation. Xi’s nun protector declined it softly, declaring, “She’s from a government official’s family, and not about to become someone’s concubine. Please return to your home for now; if she changes her mind later, I shall notify you.” As soon as he’d gone, Xi wanted to take poison and die.\n\nThat evening she dreamt that her father came to her, chiding himself by saying, “It’s because I didn’t listen to you that you’ve been brought to the present situation. It’s too late for me to regret it now. However, if you’ll just wait a little while and not kill yourself, your long-cherished wish will still come to pass.” Xi found this most strange.\n\nThe next day, when she’d finished washing, the nun visited her and remarked in surprise, “Just looking upon your face, I can tell that all the impurities have disappeared from it, and you won’t need to worry about your bad days any more. Your good fortune is on its way, so don’t forget about me.” As soon as she finished speaking, they heard the sound of a knocking at the gate. Xi turned pale, expecting it had to be a servant from the rich official’s household.\n\nWhen the nun opened the gate, sure enough, it was the servant Xi had anticipated. He immediately inquired about their plans. With pleasant words, the nun delivered a welcome, then requested that they wait for three more days. The servant brought the message from his master that if it appeared the business would come to nothing, the nun should come to face him and take the responsibility for it herself. The nun responded with courtesy and respect, offering her thanks before dismissing the servant.\n\nXi became despondent, and once again wanted to kill herself. The nun, however, stopped her from doing so. Xi worried about how they could respond to the official once the three days had passed. The nun told her, “I’m still here, and I’ll be the first one to die at their hands.”\n\nThe next day, late in the afternoon, there was a torrential rain that overturned basins with its force, and suddenly they heard several persons knocking at the gate, making a huge racket. Xi had expected there might be some disturbance, but she was so frightened and nervous that she had no idea what to do.\n\nThe nun braved the rain to open and close the gate, and they saw that there was a sedan chair parked outside; several servants lifted a beautiful woman out of it, the servants responding to her respectfully and with great deference, the way officials are treated. Surprised, the nun asked who they were, and they replied, “We’re with official Li’s family, just trying to get out of the storm for a bit.”\n\nThe lady was conducted into the convent’s hall, where she was directed to one of the beds there, and sat on it in dignified silence. The lady’s servants crowded quickly into the convent, each of them looking for someplace to rest. When they entered the meditation room and saw Xi, they thought her very lovely and ran to tell their lady.\n\nNot long after this, the rain stopped, and the lady got up, asking if she might take a look at the meditation room. When the nun led her there and she saw Xi, she thought her stunningly beautiful and stared at her without blinking. Xi also looked back at her for a good long while. The lady was Qingmei. Each of them cried out, weeping, and they told each other what they’d been doing these years.\n\nZhang’s father had succumbed to an illness, and Zhang had resumed his official duties before the mourning period for his father was over, conferring as liaison with the official in charge of a particular jurisdiction. Zhang first respectfully accompanied his mother to his new appointment, and afterwards followed along with the rest of his family and dependents.\n\nXi sighed and exclaimed, “Today, looking into each other’s eyes, it was like heaven and earth had been reconnected!”\n\nQingmei smiled and said, “It’s a good thing that you experienced misfortune and didn’t marry someone else, for heaven must have wanted the two of us to be reunited. If I hadn’t been forced by the rain to stop, how could we have had the chance to meet like this? Higher powers have provided us with this opportunity, not human efforts.” Then she picked out a pearl-studded cap and a brocade coat, and gave them to Xi to wear.\n\nXi bowed her head and hesitated to take them. The nun joined Qingmei, supporting her efforts to persuade Xi. Xi worried that if she simply lived together with Zhang, her reputation might suffer, and Qingmei replied, “In the old days we were given different positions by fate, so how could a serving girl dare forget the importance of your virtue! And thinking about Master Zhang, how could he be ungrateful to you?” So she forced Xi to wear the offered clothing and make-up. Then they said their farewell to the nun and left.\n\nWhen they arrived at Zhang’s new post, mother and son were glad to see them. Xi respectfully said, “Today I’m too ashamed to see my mother’s face.” Zhang’s mother smiled encouragingly. Hence they selected an auspicious day on which to be married. Xi remarked, “In the convent, there was a narrow road leading out, yet I couldn’t have followed it here to you. If you’ll recall our dear old days together, I’ll be satisfied with living in a cottage, with just a cushion stuffed with rushes to rest my feet on.” Qingmei smiled and said nothing.\n\nOnce the selected day arrived, the gifts in the trousseau were carried out. Xi was paralyzed with nervousness and didn’t know what to do. Suddenly she heard the marriage music and drums strike up, and Xi just couldn’t force herself to act.\n\nQingmei ordered a maidservant and an old woman to put the marriage clothes on her, and then she dragged her out to where the others were. Xi saw Zhang in his court dress, bowing to her ceremoniously, then unconsciously in her nervousness paid her respects to him all over again.\n\nQingmei pulled her into an inner chamber of the house and said, “This is the place that has been waiting for you for a long time.” Referring to Zhang, she remarked, “Tonight you’ll be able to pay your debt of gratitude, just in time.”\n\nThen she wanted to leave the couple there together. When Xi grabbed her by the gown, Qingmei laughed, and said, “Don’t try to detain me, this isn’t something I can do for you.” Qingmei loosened Xi’s hold on the gown and left.\n\nQingmei had treated Xi so faithfully, Xi dared not act like a legal wife herself. In the end, Xi felt ashamed and depressed because of it, and just didn’t feel right about it. Hence Zhang’s mother determined that she and Qingmei should both become Zhang’s legal wives. Qingmei finally ended up treating herself as Xi’s maidservant, and ignored none of the associated obligations.\n\nThree years later, Zhang was traveling to the capital to take up a new official appointment, when he passed by the convent, and took five hundred taels there to give the nun for her birthday. But the nun wouldn’t accept the money. When he insisted, she accepted two hundred taels in order to build a Buddhist temple and to set up a large stone tablet for Xi, the Lady Wang.\n\nAfterwards, Zhang became an important official and served as an assistant minister. Qingmei raised two sons and one daughter, while Xi brought up four sons and a daughter. Zhang, meanwhile, sent a memorial to the emperor, giving a full account of all that had happened, documenting that both women had been declared his first wife.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Innate beauty shall be the reward for virtuous men; but mere titles will be the inheritance for those loose descendants from rich families. Nature has certainly made such beauty something to contend for. But the ups and downs of the contention are what heaven plans so completely and so carefully. Only Qingmei was able to distinguish a real hero from dust, vowing to marry him or to die; and yet there remain those officials who abandon their morality and are nothing more than the immoral scions of the wealthy—what wisdom Qingmei showed, though just a maidservant!”",

        "id": "132",
        "title": "The Rakshas’ Sea Market",
        "body": "Ma Ji, whose courtesy name was Longmei, was the son of a merchant. He was extremely handsome in appearance. Ever since he was young, he had been unrestrainedly carefree and jolly, loving to sing and dance. He often copied the apprentices from the opera house by wrapping his head with a brocade turban, looking as gorgeous as a beautiful woman, and for that reason his stage name when performing became “the Knockout.” When he was fourteen, he entered the prefectural academy, and soon his name was already widely known.\n\nDue to his father’s declining health and old age, the elder Ma left the merchant trade and retired. He told Ma Ji, “The many books you’ve read can’t provide food for you when you’re hungry, or clothe you when you’re cold. You can still follow in my footsteps as a merchant.” Young Ma thus began gradually to engage in the business of capital and profit.\n\nWith some other people, Ma Ji embarked on a sea voyage, but they were blown off course by a typhoon, and after several days and nights they arrived at a city. The citizens there were all grotesquely ugly; when they saw Ma arrive, they thought he was a demon, turned pale, and ran off. Ma’s first glance at the locals had him just as frightened; but once he realized the local folk were also afraid of him, he decided to take advantage of them.\n\nWhen he ran into some of them who were enjoying food and drink, the locals immediately fled; and once the frightened folk had run off, Ma gulped down what they’d left behind.\n\nSome time later, he entered a mountain village. He noticed that among the inhabitants, there were some who looked like regular humans, but they were clothed like beggars. Ma decided to rest beneath a tree, and the villagers didn’t dare come near him, choosing instead to watch him from a distance.\n\nAfter quite a while, they finally decided that Ma wasn’t going to bite them, so they slowly started to come closer. Ma smiled and spoke with them. Though their language was strange, he could also make out about half of it. Then Ma told them about what had happened to him, and where he had come from. The villagers were excited to hear his story, and so they told everyone in the neighborhood that he wouldn’t pounce on them and rip them apart.\n\nHowever, the really ugly ones looked worried and kept their distance, not daring to approach him; of those who came over to him, he noticed that their mouths and noses were located in the same places as those of the people in China. They all cooperated to locate some wine, then offered it to Ma.\n\nHe asked them the reason they’d all been so scared of him, and one of them replied, “I once heard my grandfather say that 26,000 _li_ to the west lies China, whose people mostly look like monsters. Before, I simply took his word for it, but now I realize he was right.”\n\nMa asked them why they were so poor. “Our land doesn’t place the most weight on literary talent,” he was told, “but rather on appearance. The most attractive people are made high officials; the next most attractive are appointed to local public positions; those who aren’t quite as attractive as them may still seek the patronage of high officials, who can give them the means to support their wives and children in style. As for the rest of us who were born this way, our fathers and mothers consider us inauspicious, so we’re often abandoned; those who can’t bear to abandon their children seem to be more concerned that their family names are carried on.”\n\n“What do you call this country?” asked Ma.\n\n“The Great Kingdom of the Rakshas,” they told him. “The capital lies thirty _li_ to the north.” Ma requested that they lead him there so he could have a look at it. Consequently, they all started off at the first cock’s crow to conduct him there.\n\nBy daybreak, they’d reached the capital. Its walls were made from a black stone that was as dark as ink, and there were multi-storied buildings there nearly a hundred _chi_ high. However, there were few clay tiles on the roofs, which were covered instead with red stone; Ma picked up a chunk of the stone, rubbed it against the chestplate he was wearing, and it proved to be just like cinnabar.\n\nIt happened just then to be time for the raksha royal court to recess, and as one of the officials came out, the villagers pointed and said, “That’s the prime minister.” When Ma saw him, he noticed that his pair of ears were attached to the back of his head, that his nose had three nostrils, and that his bushy eyelashes covered his eyes like curtains.\n\nThen several mounted riders emerged, and the villagers reported, “They’re the grand masters.” They pointed out each of the officials and their positions as they came out, all looking generally unkempt and monstrous; however, as the lower ranking figures began to emerge, their relative ugliness also began to decrease.\n\nShortly afterwards, Ma started back with the villagers, and as the people in the streets of the city saw them coming, they noisily fell all over each other in trying to run away, as though they’d just encountered a hideous freak. The villagers repeatedly tried to calm them, till finally the city dwellers felt safe enough to stand and observe from a distance. By the time they’d returned, everyone in the entire country knew that there was an extraordinary person in the village—hence high officials contended with each other, desiring to increase their knowledge of the world, and they told the villagers that they wanted to see Ma.\n\nHowever, every time he arrived at one of their houses, the gatekeeper would always shut the gates, while the men, women, and children inside would peek at him and speak to him through cracks in the gate; by the end of the day, no one had actually invited him in for an introduction.\n\nThe villagers declared, “Around here, there’s an officer of the palace guards who was sent by our former king to visit foreign countries, and since he’s come into contact with many people, maybe he won’t be scared of you.” They headed off toward the officer’s home.\n\nThe officer, as predicted, was happy to see Ma and bowed to greet him as an honored guest. When Ma got a look at him, he found that the officer appeared to be eighty or ninety years old. His eyes bulged out from his head and his hair stood up like a hedgehog’s.\n\n“When I was young,” said the officer, “I obeyed my king’s commands, and he sent me out to many places; but the one place I never visited was China. Now that I’m over a hundred and twenty years old, and I finally get to meet a person from your venerable country, this cannot go unannounced to our king. However, I’ve been living in retirement from my official duties, and it’s been more than ten years since I last set foot on the palace stairs; but in the morning, I will go there for you.” Then he called for food and wine, and as a host treated his guest ceremoniously.\n\nWhen the wine had gone around several times, he brought out about ten female musical performers, who variously sang and danced for them. They looked like yakshas, all of them wearing white brocade turbans around their heads and red gowns that dragged along the ground. Ma didn’t recognize the lyrics to their songs, and found their tunes and rhythms weird.\n\nThe former officer happily watched the musical performances, then asked him, “Do you have music in China as well?”\n\n“Yes, we do,” answered Ma. His host invited him to mimic the sounds of Chinese music for them, so Ma drummed a rhythm on the table top and sang them a song.\n\nThe officer was delighted and declared, “How strange! It sounds like the cry of the phoenix and the roar of the dragon, and like nothing I’ve ever heard before.” The next day, the former officer hurried to the court and commended Ma to the king. The king happily issued an edict that Ma be invited to court.\n\nThere were two or three of the high officials, however, who said that Ma’s appearance was so disturbing, they feared its harmful effect on his majesty. The king then recalled the edict. The former officer came out to report this to Ma, greatly upset by the turn of events.\n\nMa stayed with the old man for quite some time; once, when they’d both been drinking, and Ma was rather tipsy, he grasped a sword and stood up to dance, then smeared his face with soot so he looked like Zhang Fei. His host thought he looked quite handsome that way and said, “Please make yourself up like Zhang Fei and go to see the prime minister—he’ll surely be happy to find a place for you, and you’ll have no trouble securing a handsome salary.”\n\n“Ha!” cried Ma. “Fooling around is alright, but how could I possibly hope that changing my appearance might help secure me a high position?” His host remained adamant about his advice, so Ma finally agreed to do it.\n\nThe officer held a banquet, inviting powerful government officials to come for drinks, directing Ma to paint his face, and then to wait for his signal. Shortly after the guests arrived, the officer called for Ma to come out and greet them. The guests were agog with wonder: “How bizarre! Before he was so ugly, but how attractive he is now!”\n\nThen they all began drinking together, growing quite jolly. Ma began dancing to “The Men’s Dart Song,” and his performance was so affecting that the seated officials were all captivated by it.\n\nThe next day, a number of them sent documents to court, recommending Ma. The king was very pleased, and summoned Ma to court as though he had the credentials of a high official. Upon receiving him, the king asked how public matters were administered in China, and Ma gave him a thorough account of his country’s legal practices, all of which was received very favorably, so the king extended to him the privilege of attending another palace banquet with him.\n\nWhen the drinking at the celebration was at its height, the king remarked, “I’ve heard that you have a talent for traditional music, so will you offer me the chance to hear it for myself?” Ma got up at once to dance, using a white turban to cover his head, singing in a languid, sensuous style. The king was very pleased with the performance, so that same day he made Ma one of his personal ministers.\n\nOver time they began to dine privately together, with the king exhibiting an unusual favor toward his new minister. After quite some time, the other palace officials and the many attendants there felt pretty certain that Ma’s appearance was a fabrication; and hence he often saw people whispering to each other instead of reacting cordially to him.\n\nMa came to feel so alienated that he no longer felt safe there. Hence he sent a memorial to the raksha king asking permission to retire from the court, but it was denied; when he asked a second time for an official leave, he was granted a three-month absence.\n\nMa thereupon was given an official carriage to carry the gifts of gold and gems he’d received at court, and he returned once again to the mountain village. The villagers crawled on their knees submissively to welcome him. Ma took the gold and valuables, divided them up, and gave a share to each of his old acquaintances who’d been so kind to him—and the sound of their cheers was thunderous.\n\n“We modest folk have received your generosity,” the villagers said, “so tomorrow when we go to the sea market, we’ll be looking for some rare curios to repay you in kind.”\n\n“What kind of place is the sea market?” asked Ma.\n\nThey replied, “A market surrounded by the sea, where mermaids and mermen from the four seas trade their merchandise of rare valuables; from the four directions and the twelve kingdoms, people unfailingly come to trade with them. Many immortals also come there to have fun. Beautiful clouds fill the sky and enormous waves periodically roll in. Since court figures and other dignified individuals won’t dare risk the dangers to go there, they hand over their gold and silk to us, so we’ll use them to purchase unusual treasures for them. Market day’s not far off now.”\n\nWhen he asked them how they knew this, they explained, “Whenever we see the vermillion bird coming and going over the sea, in seven days, it’ll be time for the sea market.” Ma asked when they would be departing, since he wanted to go with them to see the sights. The villagers tried to persuade him to think of his high standing and personal safety.\n\n“Why should I be afraid of wind and waves,” asked Ma, “since I used to be a traveler on the seas?”\n\nSoon enough, there were people arriving with their valuables to entrust to the traders, then they in turn loaded them onto a boat. It was large enough to hold dozens of people, with a flat bottom and tall sides. Then ten of the men took oars and began rowing, causing the boat to shoot through the water like an arrow.\n\nWhen three days had passed, in the distance, through the clouds hanging over the rippling waters, they saw towers stacked up one upon the other; the traders approached them in their boats, massing there like colonies of ants.\n\nShortly, they arrived just beneath the city wall. They saw that it was constructed of bricks, each as long as a person’s body. All of the towering pavilions stretched up into the sky. They moored their boat and entered the city, where they saw displays in the marketplace of odd curios and strange jewels that blinded the eyes with their radiant gleam, many of which simply didn’t exist in the human world. A young man rode up to them on a fine horse, the market traders and customers scurrying quickly to get out of his way, remarking that he was “third crown prince of the East Sea.” As the prince passed by them, he spotted Ma, and asked, “Isn’t this fellow from some foreign land?”\n\nJust then, one of the prince’s grooms came over to ask Ma where he was born. Ma bowed respectfully, greeting the prince from the roadside, and then he identified his nationality. The prince was delighted, and replied, “You’ve already honored us by your visit to our kingdom, so our acquaintance must have been destined.” Thereupon he offered Ma a horse to ride, and asked Ma to join his bridle with the prince’s own. Then they rode outside the city’s western wall.\n\nWhen they arrived at the island’s coast, their mounts whinnied and suddenly leapt into the water. Ma was terrified, and cried out involuntarily. Then he saw that the seawater had parted in the middle, like towering mountain peaks standing as walls on either side of them.\n\nIn moments, they could see a palace with beams made from tortoise shells, and roof tiles make from the scales of the bream; the walls of the palace shone brilliantly, dazzling the eyes with reflected images. Ma dismounted, bowed respectfully, and they entered.\n\nHe looked up at the Dragon Lord sitting at the front of the hall, and the prince reported to his sovereign, “I walked around in the market and came across this distinguished gentleman, who has traveled all the way from China, and I have led him here to meet you, great Lord.”\n\nMa kowtowed with elaborate gestures. The Dragon Lord then declared, “Sir, you’re obviously a literary scholar, capable of outdoing even the ancients Qu Yuan and Song Yu. I’d like to trouble you to create a poem about our ‘Sea Market,’ and hope you won’t hold back on your masterful versifying.” Ma kowtowed once again, in acceptance of the Lord’s request.\n\nHe was given a crystalline ink stone, a brush made from the bristles of a dragon’s mane, some dazzling snow-white paper, and ink that gave off the scent of orchids. Ma immediately completed more than a thousand words of poetry and offered it to the Dragon Lord. The sovereign beat out a rhythm while reciting the verse, and then declared, “Sir, your great talent has illuminated our kingdom of the sea!”\n\nThen all of the Dragon Lord’s people were gathered together for a feast in his palace. Once the wine and roasted meats had made many rounds, the Dragon Lord grasped his own wine vessel, turned towards his special guest, and said, “I have worried that there wasn’t a good match for my dear daughter, so now I would like to make her your burden. Sir, in that case, would you be interested?” Ma rose from his seat in profound gratitude, excitedly repeating yes, of course he’d be interested.\n\nThe Dragon Lord turned to speak to the attendants standing behind him. Soon a number of palace maids brought out a young woman. Jade rings at her waist tinkled as she moved, as drum beats rang out sharply. Once Ma finished bowing respectfully, he glanced quickly at her and found her a most beautiful woman indeed. She bowed respectfully in return to him, and then left.\n\nMoments later, the festivities were concluded, and two young maidservants carried in decorative lanterns to lead Ma into another wing of the palace. There the Dragon Lord’s daughter, wearing elaborate make-up and fabulous clothing, sat waiting for him. The bed, made from coral, was decorated with gold and silver, natural pearl, and agate; enormous, bright pearls had been sewn into the curtain tassels outside the bed, while the quilts and mattress were fragrant and soft.\n\nAt sunrise, both innocent girl servants, and more experienced maids, rushed in and surrounded the bed. Ma got up, hurried to court, and thanked the Dragon Lord. There he was greeted as the sovereign’s son-inlaw.\n\nThe poetry he had composed for the Dragon Lord was quickly disseminated throughout the four seas. The Dragon Lords of all of them sent special emissaries to convey their congratulations to him; they also delivered letters inviting the Dragon Lord’s new son-in-law for banquets. Ma put on brocade clothing and climbed into a carriage drawn by a small green horned dragon, while the palace servants shouted for his path to be cleared as he rode out.\n\nNearly a dozen palace guards accompanied him, carrying engraved bows and lotus-white staffs, surrounding him in their shining armor. Musicians on horseback played stringed instruments as they journeyed, while others in a carriage played jade flutes. In three day’s time, Ma had completed all of his travels. From this point forward, the name of this Longmei echoed throughout the four seas.\n\nIn the palace, there grew a locust tree with a trunk as big around as one might reach with both arms; its base was sparkling and crystal-clear, like transparent glass, while inside, its core, which was a light yellow color, was a bit smaller around than a person’s arm; its foliage was the color of blue-green jade and about as thick as a coin, creating a dense shade. Ma often took his bride there so they could sing poetry beneath it.\n\nThe tree was full of blooming flowers that looked like cape jasmine flowers. As the flower petals fell and hit the ground, they made a gong-like sound. He picked one up to examine it, and it appeared to have been sculpted from red agate, delicate and lovely. From time to time, rare birds with feathers that were gold and jade in color, their tails longer than their entire bodies, would land there, and sing with a melancholic quality equal to the laments played on jade flute, that would move listeners to the bottom of their hearts. Whenever Ma heard them, he always thought of his home town.\n\nBecause of this, he told his wife, “Three years have gone by while I’ve been separated from my father and mother, and every time I think of them, the tears fall down my chest. Would you return home with me?”\n\n“Otherworldly beings and those of the mortal world travel different paths,” she replied, “and cannot always live together. But I cannot ask you to sacrifice your family bonds just because of our happy married life. Let me think of a solution for you.” When Ma heard her response, he couldn’t stop himself from weeping. His wife sighed and exclaimed, “You cannot have both of them!”\n\nThe next day, Ma returned to the palace. The Dragon Lord said, “I’ve heard that you’ve been thinking about your homeland, so if at dawn tomorrow we can have your things ready to go, will that be satisfactory?”\n\nMa thanked him and replied, “When I was a lonely traveler, you received and honored me with your generous favor, and in sincere gratitude, with every fibre of my being, I want to repay you for everything. Permit me a brief return to my home, then I’ll undertake to rejoin you.”\n\nAt dusk, Ma’s wife set out some wine to accompany their parting words. Ma proposed when they could meet again in the future. His wife declared, “The good fortune that brought us together has been exhausted.”\n\nMa was terribly saddened, so his wife told him, “Go home and care for your parents, so they can see that you’re a filial son. When in human life we meet and part, a hundred years are like a single morning and evening, so what use is it to complain like a child? Henceforth I will be faithful to you alone, and you will be true to me, and though we occupy two different places, we’ll be of one heart, still husband and wife; so why must we be close by each other when we can say that we’re still growing old together? If we go back on the words of this pact, our marriage will suffer for it. If you’re thinking that there’ll be no one to do the housework, you can marry a concubine to do it. There’s still one piece of business I have to discuss with you: When I was changing my clothes, I found that I am pregnant, so I need to trouble you to name our child.”\n\n“If she’s a girl, we can name her Longgong; if he’s a boy,” said Ma, “we can call him Fuhai.” His wife then begged from him a token of their mutual pledge. In the raksha kingdom, Ma had been given a pair of lotus flowers carved from red jade, so he took them out, and she accepted them from him.\n\nHis wife declared, “Three years from now, after the eighth day of the fourth month, you must sail south to an island, and I will return your child to you.” She took a bag made from fish skins, filled it with pearls and gems, then gave it to Ma, saying, “Keep these treasures safe, and for several generations your family will never go hungry.”\n\nAs soon as the sky showed the slightest rays of light, the Dragon Lord set up a farewell feast for Ma, and showered him with precious gifts. Ma bowed gratefully to take his leave of the sovereign, and departed from the palace.\n\nHis wife rode in a carriage drawn by white rams and accompanied him all the way to the sea shore. Ma rode out onto the beach and then dismounted. His wife got out and called to him to take care of himself, then returned to her carriage and set forth, till in a few moments she was far in the distance. The sea that had originally separated to let them pass, closed up again, and he could no longer see her.\n\nMa then made his return home. He had been away for so long on his voyage that everyone was saying he was dead; now that he’d come home, his family members were completely dumbfounded. Fortunately, his father and mother were in good health, but his lonely wife had already found another husband.\n\nAt that moment, he understood the words of the Dragon Lord’s daughter, “I will be faithful to you alone,” meaning that she must have known what had already happened. His father wanted Ma to remarry; but he couldn’t do it, and only acquired a concubine.\n\nOnce the three years specified had been conscientiously observed, Ma sailed to the specified island. He saw two children sitting afloat on the water’s surface, laughing and playing as they slapped at the waters around them, without moving or sinking. As he came near them, one child silently grabbed his arm and leaped up into a hug. The other then began wailing as though upset that Ma didn’t pick her up, too. So he also lifted up the second child. When he looked carefully at them, Ma found one was a boy and the other a girl, while both possessed gentle, lovely features.\n\nOn their heads they wore gaily decorated caps, and each cap had one of the red jade lotus flowers attached. At the back of one of the caps, there was a small silk bag, and when he detached it and looked inside, he found a letter that read, “I hope my father- and mother-in-law are in good health. These three years have passed rapidly, and the mortal world remains as unapproachable as ever; over such vast waters, it’s ever more difficult for the messenger birds to get through. It seems like it’s all become just a dream, watching with aching neck for some sign, only to grow weary of staring into the blue—it’s just so frustrating!\n\n“Then I think with affection of Chang’e, and her lonely life in the Cinnamon Wing of the Moon Palace; and of the Weaving Maid, who threw down her shuttle, and even now sorrowfully watches for her beloved from beyond the Milky Way. Who am I, that I should be able to enjoy eternal love? When I start to think about that, my foolish tears turn to laughter.\n\n“Two months after you left, I gave birth to twins. Now they’re already chirping like parakeets, jumping up into my arms, and they understand both language and laughter; they find jujube fruits and pick pears for themselves, no longer needing their mother to feed them. I now offer them respectfully to you. I placed the red jade lotus flowers on their caps to signify my pledge to you. When, on your knees, you embrace the children, it’ll be like I’m there with you.\n\n“I heard that you honored your old pact with me, and this dedication gives me comfort. In this life till I die, you will be the one and only man for me. In my precious make-up case, I’ve saved no scented facial crèmes; when I see myself in the mirror, I’m reminded that I haven’t made up my face in a long time. You’re like a traveler on a long journey, and I am the traveler’s wife—though they’re far away from each other, they still have the titles of husband and wife, so how can anyone say that they’re not a harmonious couple?\n\n“My only desire is for your parents to be able to hug their grandchildren, though they haven’t even met their son’s bride, for when I consider my obligations to them, I find myself most deficient. In the coming year, when my mother-in-law is placed in her grave, I must come to the site to mourn, and to fulfill my duty as her daughter-in-law.\n\n“From this time forward, I hope that Longgong will never be ill, and that I may hold her in my arms many more times; may Fuhai have a long life, and may he often travel the road to come to me. I hope you will take good care of yourself, though I haven’t managed to express all I wanted to say to you.” Ma read the letter over and over again, wiping away his tears with his arm.\n\nThe two children hugged him around the neck and cried, “We have to go home!”\n\nMa became even more grief-stricken, and asked them, “Do you know how to find your way home?” Fuhai and Longgong started sobbing, hoarsely crying that they wanted to go home. Ma looked out over the boundless waters of the sea, limitless along the horizon separating earth and sky; fog obscured any route to the Dragon Lord’s daughter, the mist-covered waters a dead-end road. He took the children in his arms, returned to his boat, and with a heavy heart turned homeward.\n\nRecognizing that his mother didn’t have long to live, Ma made all the arrangements for her coffin and burial service in advance, and around her tomb he planted more than a hundred pine and cedar trees. Once the year came to an end, his mother died.\n\nWhen the funeral carriage arrived at her burial site, there was a woman dressed in hempen mourning clothes who stood near the tomb. The group of mourners looked on in amazement as suddenly the wind whipped up and thunder crashed, followed by a spontaneous and heavy rain—and in a flash, the woman was no longer there. Many of the pines and cedars that had been so recently planted were left withered, but afterwards they all came back to life.\n\nAs Fuhai grew a little older, he often thought of his mother, and consequently, on the spur of the moment, he would often fling himself into the sea, and it would be several days before he came back. Since Longgong was a girl, she wasn’t allowed to go with him, so she’d just shut herself in her room and cry.\n\nOne day, as the sun was setting, the Dragon Lord’s daughter suddenly appeared to Longgong, to stop her grieving, declaring, “You’ll have your own family in time, so what’s the point of crying now?” Then she gave her a tree made of coral that was eight _chi_ long, a packet of camphor incense, a hundred shiny pearls, and a pair of gold boxes, inlaid with eight precious gems, all to serve as her dowry.\n\nWhen Ma heard her voice, he quickly broke into Longgong’s room, grasped her hand, and began sobbing. In an instant, a sudden thunderclap rocked the room, and his wife vanished.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The way in which painted faces in our world are fawned over, is just like what Ma experienced among the demons. Weird habits that treat ugliness as beauty are common in every kind of world. ‘Moderately flattering activities, while disobeying existing morals, receive moderate approval, and extremely flattering activities, while disobeying existing morals, receive extreme approval.’ If a man were to expose his true face as he went on his way through the city, he shouldn’t be at all astonished to find that those who saw him would run for cover. Where can the fool of Lingyang go to cry about his extraordinarily valuable jade? Alas! Fame and wealth is only to be found in mirages like the rakshas’ sea market!”",

        "id": "133",
        "title": "Tian Qilang",
        "body": "Wu Chengxiu lived in Liaoyang. He enjoyed making friends, all of whom were well-known celebrities. One night he dreamt that someone told him, “You’ve made friends from all over the country, but you’ve made them indiscriminately. Only one person can share your trials and tribulations, so why not get to know him instead?”\n\nWu asked, “Who is this person?”\n\n“Who else but Tian Qilang,” the voice replied. When he woke up, he thought it an odd dream.\n\nThe next morning, he asked everyone he ran into whether they knew this Tian Qilang. One visitor seemed to remember that the man lived in a village to the east and was a hunter by profession. Wu paid a visit to Tian’s home, using his whip to knock at the door.\n\nSoon a man came out who looked like he was in his twenties, with wild, bestial eyes, and a slender waist, wearing a greasy, round cap, and black pants covered with many white patches. Raising his folded hands to his forehead in greeting, he asked Wu where he was from.\n\nWu introduced himself; in addition, he used the pretext of feeling rather unwell from his journey to ask if he might rest in the house for a bit. When he asked the man who Tian Qilang was, he replied, “That’s me.” Then Tian invited his guest to come inside.\n\nWu saw that the house was run-down, with tree branches braced against the walls to support them. They entered a small room where tiger skins and wolf pelts were hanging suspended from the beams, and there were no stools or beds to sit upon. Tian spread out a tiger skin for them, and they sat down on it.\n\nAs Wu spoke with him, he found Tian Qilang’s words to be simple and unpretentious, so he liked him immensely. He hastily offered Tian some money to supplement his livelihood, but Qilang wouldn’t accept it. When Wu remained insistent, Tian relented, received the silver, and took it to his mother.\n\nIn a few moments he returned, and gave the money back to Wu, resolutely stating he couldn’t accept it. Wu strongly urged him again to keep it. Tian’s elderly mother came into the room, and with a stern countenance, declared “I only have this one son, so I don’t want him to become the servant of some noble guest!” Wu felt embarrassed and quickly withdrew.\n\nAs he was heading home, Wu turned her words over and over again in his head, but he just couldn’t understand what she had meant. One of the servants traveling with Wu had overheard from the back of the room what the mother had told her son earlier, and so he reported it to Wu. At the time, Tian had carried the silver to his mother, she had told him, “When I saw that young gentleman, I noticed that he had unlucky lines on his face, meaning that he will surely suffer the misfortune of an unexpected disaster. I’ve heard it said that if you receive assistance from someone, you must take a share of that person’s burdens, and if you receive the help of someone else, you must hurry to aid that person in difficult times. A rich man can repay others with money, but a poor man can only offer his sense of honor and obligation. A person doesn’t offer so much money without a reason—it’s inauspicious—and I’m afraid that if you take it, repaying it will cost you your life.”\n\nWhen Wu heard this, he gave a deep sigh of respect for the mother’s prudence; moreover, it made him admire Tian Qilang all the more.\n\nThe next day, Wu had a dinner prepared and invited Tian over, but he said he couldn’t come. Wu then came to visit Tian at his home, where he sat down and asked for something to drink. Tian himself brought out the wine for Wu, and he set out some dried deer meat, ceremoniously serving as host to the best of his ability.\n\nThe following day, Wu again invited Tian to come drink with him, and this time he came. The two, cordial and harmonious, enjoyed themselves greatly. Wu offered Tian the silver once again, but he still wouldn’t accept it. Wu used the pretext that he wanted to buy some tiger skins from Tian, who then agreed to take the money.\n\nTian returned home and checked to see how many skins he’d stored up, but by his calculations he didn’t have enough to merit the sum he’d been given, so he decided to hunt for more tigers, and afterwards to offer Wu their skins as well. He went into the mountains for three days, but returned without having captured anything. His wife then fell ill, so he had to look after her, administering her medicine, and hence didn’t have time to continue hunting.\n\nAfter ten days, his wife suddenly died. Tian provided meals for the monks who conducted the ceremony for his wife’s burial, using a bit of the silver from Wu to pay the costs. Wu appeared personally to express his condolences, treating Tian with great respect and courtesy.\n\nOnce the funeral was concluded, Tian took his crossbow into the mountain forests, thinking to repay Wu, but once again was unsuccessful. When Wu found out why he’d done this, he insistently told him not to worry about hasty repayment. He also expressed that he was eagerly anxious for Tian to visit him again; but Tian was so distressed about being in debt to him that he avoided agreeing to stop over. Wu then said that he wanted to look through the older tiger skins Tian had, hoping to settle matters so Tian could come over as soon as possible.\n\nUpon inspecting the pelts, Tian discovered that they’d been ruined, that the fur had completely fallen out, so he became even more upset. When Wu found out about this, he speedily traveled to Tian’s home to try his best to calm him down.\n\nOnce he examined the ruined hides, he declared, “That’s even better. All I wanted was the hides anyway, not the fur that was on them.” Then he rolled up the skins to go home, inviting Tian to come with him. Tian said he couldn’t leave, so Wu went on home alone.\n\nTian finally decided that this wouldn’t represent adequate repayment of Wu, so he gathered provisions and went back into the mountains, then after several nights he bagged a perfect tiger specimen, and presented its pelt to Wu. He was extremely pleased, so he had lodging prepared, and invited Tian to stay with him for three days. Tian firmly declined. Wu then actually locked the doors in his courtyard, ensuring that Tian couldn’t slip away.\n\nWhen the other guests noticed Tian’s crude outfit, they privately said to themselves that Wu had formed a ridiculous friendship. But Wu socialized quite differently with Tian than with any of his other guests. He tried to get Tian to exchange his rags for some new clothing, but Tian refused to do so; when he fell asleep, Wu secretly swapped them, so he had no choice but to accept them.\n\nTian returned home, and after that, his son respectfully followed the orders of his grandmother to return the new garb to Wu, in order to retrieve his father’s worn-out clothing. Wu chuckled and replied, “Go home and tell your grandmother that I’ve torn the old rags into strips to pad my shoes.” From then on, Tian sent rabbit and venison meat to him daily, and though Wu asked him to visit, he never appeared.\n\nWu one day went to see Tian, who was out hunting at the time, and hadn’t yet returned. Tian’s mother came out, hobbled over to the door, and exclaimed, “Don’t have anything more to do with my son, because it’s certainly not doing him any kindness!” Wu respectfully apologized to her, abashed, and withdrew.\n\nAbout half a year elapsed, and then one his servants suddenly told Wu, “While Tian Qilang was out hunting leopards, he beat and killed a man, so he’s been arrested by officers and taken into custody.” Wu, mortified, hurried off to look into the matter.\n\nWhen Tian saw Wu, he didn’t say anything, but then muttered, “I need to trouble you to take care of my mother from now on.” Filled with sorrow, Wu left, then quickly delivered a huge sum of money as a bribe to the county magistrate; he also took a hundred taels to compensate the dead man’s relatives.\n\nIn a little more than a month, Tian was freed and allowed to go home. His mother was deeply moved, and told him, “You’ve now received a second life from Master Wu, so I mustn’t try to keep you all to myself any longer. Hence I wish for Master Wu a long life free from disasters, and equally good fortune for you.” Tian said he wanted to express his gratitude to Wu, but his mother replied, “Go since you must, but don’t thank Master Wu. You can offer thanks for small kindnesses, but not for a great favor.”\n\nTian went to see Wu; though Wu’s friendly words were aimed at comforting him, Tian offered nothing in response but subdued acknowledgment of them. Wu’s family members thought this detached attitude was rather unappreciative; yet Wu was pleased with Tian’s ingenuousness, and became even more generous to him. After this, Tian stayed in Wu’s home regularly for several days at a time whenever invited. He accepted everything Wu offered him, neither declining nor replying gratefully.\n\nOn the occasion of one of Wu’s birthdays, a profusion of guests and servants, who were staying the night, filled his halls. Wu and Tian shared a bed in one small room, while three servants slept on hay piled on the floor below them. After the servants all fell asleep, the two men, facing each other, continued chatting.\n\nThe sword that Tian normally wore at his waist was hanging on the wall when suddenly it popped several _cun_ out of its scabbard, with a clanging noise, and flashed a beam as brilliant as lightning. Wu was startled, and sat up. Tian was also roused, and asked, “Who’s that sleeping there on the floor?”\n\n“They’re all servants of mine,” Wu replied.\n\nTian told him, “There must be an evildoer among them.” Wu asked why, and Tian explained, “This sword was obtained in a foreign country, and can kill a man without shedding a drop of blood on his clothing. Before me, three generations of my family have carried it. It’s taken off the heads of thousands, yet it looks like it’s just been sharpened and polished on a whetstone. When it sees an evildoer who will be killed soon, it makes its clang and leaps out. Master Wu, you should restrict your acquaintances to gentlemen, avoiding lowlife types, and perhaps then you can be spared disaster.”\n\nWu nodded in agreement. Tian, however, took no comfort from this, tossing and turning fitfully on the bed. “Now that we’re clear about the misfortune or good luck ahead,” said Wu, “why are you so deeply worried?”\n\nTian replied, “I’m not afraid for myself; I simply worry about my aged mother.”\n\n“Then what are you so concerned about?” asked Wu.\n\n“That nothing changes for the worse,” he answered.\n\nWithin the group of three servants on the floor was one Lin Er, a handsome boy who’d long been a favorite, and kept their master happy; the second was a houseboy, twelve or thirteen years old, who often ran errands for Wu. Another was Li Ying, who was stubborn and clumsy, always gave Wu surly looks, and argued about trifling matters, so his master was constantly angry with him. That night, thinking things over, Wu suspected that Li must be the evildoer detected by the sword. The next morning, Wu called out to Li, spoke generously to him, but also firmly dismissed him.\n\nWu’s eldest son, Wu Shen, had married a woman from the Wang family. One day, Wu went out and left Lin Er to take care of the house. The chrysanthemums from the inner courtyard of Wu’s study were magnificent just then. Shen’s new bride figured that since her father-in-law had gone out, his study’s courtyard would be unoccupied, so she could go in and began picking some chrysanthemums.\n\nLin Er burst in, and started forcing himself on her. The girl tried to get away from him, so Lin Er grabbed her and pushed her into a room. She cried and resisted till she was pale and hoarse. As Shen then rushed in, Lin Er released his grip and ran off. When Wu returned home and heard what had happened, he angrily went out looking for Lin Er, but eventually gave up because he had no idea where he was.\n\nTwo or three days later, they learned that Lin Er had found employment with a certain imperial censor’s household. This official was away in the capital, so he transferred all responsibility for his household to his younger brother. Since they were old colleagues, Wu sent a letter to the brother, requiring him to turn over Lin Er, but the brother just set it aside, without opening it. Wu became even more furious, and wrote to the county magistrate. Although a warrant for Lin Er’s arrest was issued, no bailiffs were sent to arrest him, and the magistrate didn’t inquire any further into the matter.\n\nJust as Wu’s rage was exploding, Tian arrived. Wu told him, “Your words proved perfectly accurate.” He then informed Tian what Lin Er had done. A horrible expression came over Tian’s face, and he dashed off without uttering a word.\n\nWu assigned some servants to keep an eye out for Lin Er. One night he returned, and the patrolling servants captured him, and took him to see Wu. Wu then had him lightly flogged. In response, Lin Er said something obscene to Wu. His uncle, Wu Heng, a venerable old gentleman, fearing that Wu in his violent rage might do something improper, which could become a misfortune for him later, persuaded him it would be better to have the local officials punish him. Wu went along with this, bound Lin Er, and sent him to the law court.\n\nThen the family of the imperial censor wrote a letter to the county magistrate’s office; the magistrate released Lin Er, who then returned to the official’s household as a housekeeper. Lin Er began to act even more reprehensibly, starting rumors that he had slept with Wu’s daughter-in-law. Helpless to stop him, Wu was so frustrated with anger that he wished to die. He hurried to the official’s gate, and animatedly condemned the estate’s inhabitants. Local residents eventually calmed him down, and talked him into going home.\n\nThe following night, a servant suddenly appeared and informed him, “Lin Er’s body was chopped up, and the remains were tossed out into the wilderness.” Wu, pleasantly surprised, felt his anger dissipate.\n\nSoon he heard that the official’s household had filed a charge against him and his uncle, hence he accompanied his uncle to court for the investigation. The magistrate refused to hear their side of it, ordering Wu Heng to be flogged. Wu kicked up a fuss and cried, “We’re no murderers! I came to scold the court official’s household, that’s true, but my uncle had nothing to do with that.”\n\nThe magistrate wouldn’t listen to him. Wu glared wide-eyed in anger and tried to stop them, but a group of servants seized him, preventing him from interfering. The servants doing the flogging had been bribed to do the bidding of the imperial censor’s family, so despite the fact that Wu Heng was an elderly man, they beat him so often that though they weren’t even halfway finished, he was already dying.\n\nThe magistrate witnessed Wu’s uncle fall down dead, but made no effort to pursue the matter further. Though Wu yelled and cursed at him, the magistrate just acted like he hadn’t heard him. Wu then carried his uncle’s body home, sad and outraged that there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nHe had wanted to consult with Tian Qilang about strategies, but Tian still hadn’t come by to pay his respects to Wu Heng. Wu privately thought to himself, I’ve treated Qilang with no disrespect, so why is he keeping his distance from me, like a stranger? Wu also suspected that Lin Er’s killer was almost certainly Tian.\n\nBut on second thought, he reasoned: If that were really the case, why hasn’t he come and discussed things with me? Hence he sent a man to Tian’s house to find out what was going on, and when the man arrived there, he found the door hasp fixed in place, while Tian’s neighbors knew nothing of his whereabouts.\n\nOne day, the younger brother of the imperial censor was in an inner room of the county court office, paying a bribe to the magistrate. It happened to be the time of the morning for firewood and water to be brought in, so suddenly a woodcutter arrived, set down what he was carrying, drew out his razor-sharp blade, then rushed straight at the brother.\n\nIn frenzied terror, the brother put up his hand to try to deflect the blade, but when it came down, it sliced off his hand at the wrist; another slash of the blade sheared off his head. The magistrate fled in horror.\n\nThe woodcutter fiercely looked around for his other target. All of the bailiffs anxiously closed up the office’s gate, took up poles for weapons, and started yelling. The woodcutter then cut his own throat and died.\n\nIn succession, people came by to see if they recognized him, and someone said that it was Tian Qilang. When the frightened magistrate had calmed down completely, he came out to check on the matter. He saw Tian lying dead in a pool of blood, his hand still grasping the blade. As the magistrate stopped his subordinates from covering up the body, so he could look at it closely, the corpse suddenly sprang up and finished the job by cutting off the magistrate’s head, then once again fell down, stiff and dead.\n\nThe magistrate’s assistant went to arrest Tian’s mother and his son, but learned that they had escaped several days before.\n\nWhen Wu heard that Tian Qilang was dead, he hurried to the site, weeping piteously. Some people said that it was Wu, Tian’s patron, who had suborned him to commit the murders. Wu bankrupted himself while bribing those with the power to decide against him, sacrificing everything he had, and consequently was exempted from punishment.\n\nTian’s body was left out in the open wilderness, where for more than thirty days, birds and dogs stationed themselves on guard around it. Wu then took the body, and gave it a lavish burial ceremony. Tian’s son drifted from place to place, until he finally settled down to live in Dengzhou, changing his surname to Tong. He joined the army, and through merit eventually advanced to become a general. When Tong finally returned to Liaoyang, his hometown, Wu, who had already turned eighty, conducted the younger man to the grave of his father, Tian Qilang.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Even the smallest amount of money shouldn’t be accepted lightly, just as one mustn’t take for granted the meals that have been received. Tian’s mother was exactly right! Qilang, frustrated that he couldn’t wipe out his old debts of gratitude, died, but stood up again to repay them—and how did he accomplish such magic? If Jing Ke had been able to do the same thing, a thousand years of resentment could have been avoided. I wish there were more men like Tian Qilang, to make up for all the injustice that has been ignored by heaven; however, in such a world as ours, there are too few men like him. What a pity!”",

Bao proceeded to clamber up the timbers, reaching the top in mere moments; standing above the ridgepole, he quickly walked three or four circuits of the perimeter; when he was finished, he jumped all the way down from the top, landing upright on his feet.\n\nPrince Wu had a beloved concubine who owned an extraordinary pipa. Its fingerboard was made of warm jade, so whenever she brought it out, it had the effect of making the entire room feel warm. The concubine kept the precious instrument concealed, and without the written order of the prince, she wouldn’t take it out to show anyone.\n\nOne night, as the prince had people gathered together for a dinner, the guests requested a look at the rare pipa. The prince was feeling a bit sluggish just then, and said they might expect to see it the next day.\n\nBao, who was at his side at the time, said, “With no disrespect, I could get it for you, even without your order to authorize me.” The prince told someone to hurry and tell those inside and outside the mansion house to be on guard, then dispatched Bao to fetch the pipa.\n\nBao passed more than ten thick walls, and finally reached the concubine’s courtyard. He could see a lamp shining brightly in her room, but the door bolt was fastened, so he couldn’t get in. Below the veranda, there was a parrot in a wooden cage. Bao made the sound of a cat’s voice; then he imitated a parrot’s voice, crying out, “There’s a cat here.” He made it sound like the parrot was thrashing about in its cage, the noise increasing as it grew more panicked.\n\nBao heard the concubine tell a servant, “You, quickly, go see—something’s trying to kill my parrot!” He hid himself in the shadows. In moments, a maidservant carrying a lantern came out, and as soon as she was out the door, Bao slipped inside.\n\nHe saw that the concubine had placed the pipa on a small table, so he made off with it straightaway. Spotting the theft, the stunned concubine managed to shout, “There’s a thief,” and the guards nearby all came running. Bao left with the pipa in his arms, and his pursuers couldn’t catch up with him, though the arrows they shot at him fell like rain.\n\nBao jumped, and climbed up into a tree. Beside the wall, there were over thirty enormous scholartrees, so Bao made his way through the treetops, like a bird hopping from branch to branch; from the end of the tree grove, he stepped out onto the house, and from the edge of the house, he made his way to the higher building; he dashed into the hall of the main pavilion as swiftly as a bird in flight, so suddenly that no one realized he was there.\n\nThe guests were drinking as Bao suddenly appeared before the banquet carrying the pipa—the door still barred as it had been—to the shocked silence of everyone present.",

        "body": "Most of the people implicated and punished for being involved in Yu Qi’s rebellion were from Qixia and Laiyang counties. Each day, several hundred people were captured and executed at the military training grounds. Their blood soaked the earth, and their bones stacked up to the sky. Out of pity, high officials donated coffins made from the timber supplies in Jinan coffin shops. For that reason, many of the bodies were buried in the countryside south of Jinan.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of Emperor Kangxi’s reign, a scholar from Laiyang came to Jinan, having lost two or three relatives and friends among the many who’d been executed, so he purchased some paper money to burn, and some wine for libations, then went to their burial mounds where he held a memorial ceremony. Afterwards, he rented a lodging in a building belonging to a Buddhist monastery.\n\nThe next day, he entered Jinan to manage some business, and didn’t return at nightfall. Meanwhile, a young man had arrived suddenly to pay him a visit. Seeing that the scholar wasn’t there, he took off his cap, climbed onto the scholar’s bed, and laid down without even removing his shoes. A servant asked him who he was, but the young man just shut his eyes without answering him.\n\nWhen the scholar returned later in the evening darkness, he couldn’t tell what the visitor looked like. He went over to the bed and asked the young man who he was. Staring at the scholar, he replied, “I’m waiting for your master, but you keep pressing me with questions like I’m some kind of bandit!”\n\nThe scholar smiled and declared, “The master’s right here.” The young man got up and put on his cap, bowed with his hands clasped together, and then sat down to exchange sincere greetings.\n\nAs the scholar listened to his voice, it seemed to belong to someone he’d met before. Anxiously he called for a lamp to be brought over and saw that the young man was Zhu Sheng, who’d been executed for being implicated in Yu Qi’s rebellion. In horror, the scholar backed away frantically.\n\nZhu took his arm and said, “I was your friend, so why are you acting this way? Though I’m a ghost, I think of our friendship often, and can’t get it out of my mind. Now there’s something I need to trouble you about, so I hope you won’t regard me as something strange, and then think badly of me.” The scholar sat down, asking him to explain what he wanted. Zhu replied, “Your niece is unmarried and lives alone, and I’d like to make her my wife. Time and time again, I’ve sent matchmakers and go-betweens to her, but she always responds that she hasn’t been authorized by her elder relatives to accept a proposal, so she declines. It would be most helpful if you could put in a few good words of support for me.”\n\nIt was true that the scholar originally had a niece in his care, whose mother had died when she was young, and who was to be raised by him until she was fifteen, at which time she would return to her home. But she was among those captured and taken to Jinan, where, shocked and grief-stricken upon hearing that her father had been put to death, she also died.\n\nThe scholar replied to Zhu, “She has a father, so why bring your request to me?”\n\n“Her father’s nephew unearthed his coffin, and left with it,” Zhu explained, “so now it’s no longer here.”\n\n“With whom is she staying?” asked the scholar.\n\nZhu replied, “She’s living with an old neighbor woman.” The scholar was worried that a living person would be no match for a ghost. Zhu told him, “If you’ll grant me your esteemed approval, I’ll gratefully ask you to go there in person.” Then he stood and took hold of the scholar’s hand.\n\nThe scholar declined firmly before asking, “How would we go?”\n\nZhu exclaimed, “Just walk along!” At Zhu’s urging, the scholar followed along, and they left together.\n\nTraveling north about a _li_, they came to a large, rundown village of about a hundred houses. When they came to one particular house, Zhu knocked on the door till an old woman appeared. Opening two doors just a crack, she asked Zhu, “What is it?”\n\nHe answered, “Please inform the young lady that her uncle has arrived.”\n\nThe old woman turned and went back in, then came out again moments later, inviting the scholar inside. With a gesture, she told Zhu, “There are two rather narrow thatched huts in the courtyard, so please have a seat and wait outside for the gentleman.” The scholar followed after her. He noticed a half _mu_ span of ruined courtyard where the two small huts were situated.\n\nHis niece welcomed him at the door of the house, sobbing, and the scholar joined in with his own weeping. The room inside was illuminated with shimmering lights. The niece appeared as beautiful and wholesome as when she was alive. Looking at the scholar through her tears, she asked repeatedly about her aunt’s in-laws. The scholar replied, “They’re all in good health, though my wife has passed away.”\n\nThe niece then cried, “When I was a child, uncle and aunt took care of me, yet I haven’t ever repaid you and didn’t expect that I would die first and be buried in a ditch, so it’s especially regretful. Last year, the son of father’s elder brother moved father’s body, without giving me a thought; with him several hundred _li_ away, I’m as lonely as an autumn swallow. Uncle, you didn’t abandon me, even though I’m just a spirit in the underworld, and I did receive the money and goods you burned for me.”\n\nThen when the scholar told her about Zhu’s interest in her, she bowed her head and wouldn’t speak. “Master Zhu has previously entrusted old lady Yang a number of times to bring his proposal,” replied the old woman. “I say it’s an excellent opportunity; but the young lady isn’t about to rush into anything, so now that you’re here to permit her to marry, they both can be satisfied this time.”\n\nIn the course of the conversation, a young woman, seventeen or eighteen years old, and followed by a servant, hastily but modestly entered; upon catching sight of the scholar, she turned around to flee. The niece grabbed at her gown, and said, “You don’t have to do that! This is my uncle, not just some other person.” The scholar bowed politely. The young woman reciprocated his courtesy.\n\n“This is Jiuniang,” the niece explained, “from the Gongsun clan in Qixia. Her papa was the son of a prominent family, but now that it has fallen on hard times, the family’s withdrawn from social contacts that it can no longer afford. Day and night, she comes and goes here.”\n\nThe scholar glanced at her quickly, noticing her eyebrows arched like the smiling curve of an autumn moon, and her cheeks’ bashful, rosy glow—truly an unparalleled beauty. He declared, “I could tell she had to be from a rich and influencial family, for a simple person couldn’t possibly be this incredibly beautiful.”\n\nHis niece smiled and said, “In addition, she’s a scholar, and all of her poetry is of high quality. She even advised me a bit on my own poetry last night.”\n\nWith a small grin, Jiuniang replied, “You little mischief-maker, don’t exaggerate my short-comings—you’ll make your uncle laugh at me.”\n\nThe niece also grinned as she said, “Uncle lost his wife and hasn’t remarried, so what about it, Jiuniang, wouldn’t that be wonderful?”\n\nJiuniang laughed and rushed out, shouting, “A bump in the head must’ve made you crazy!” Then she was gone. Though her words seemed merely playful, the scholar felt very attracted to her.\n\nAs though his niece could tell how he was feeling, she told him, “Jiuniang’s talents and beauty are matchless, so if you don’t mind the fact that she’s already dead, I’ll present a proposal to Jiuniang’s mother for you.” The scholar was very pleased. However, he wondered about whether it would be possible for a living person to be married to a ghost. His niece reassured him, “It doesn’t matter since this was fated to happen.” The scholar then prepared to leave.\n\nHis niece accompanied him, saying, “Five days from now, when the moon’s bright and everyone’s asleep, I’ll send someone to fetch you.” The scholar walked out through the doorway, but didn’t see Zhu anywhere. As he raised his head and looked westward in the sky, the pale yellow half-moon was shining, so he was able to recognize the path that they’d taken earlier.\n\nWhen he spotted a residence facing the south, Zhu, who was sitting on a stone at its gate, got up and said, “I’ve been waiting a long time for you, so please let me trouble you to come inside my house for a rest.”\n\nAs he took the scholar’s hand and they went inside, Zhu thanked him with effusive courtesy. He brought out a gold wine cup and a hundred pearls from Shanxi, remarking, “I don’t have anything but these, so I hope they’ll serve as simple betrothal gifts.” Later he remarked, “I have some unstrained wine in the house, but since it came from the underworld, it’s unworthy of my honored guest, so what’s to be done!” The scholar expressed his gratitude for everything, and took his leave. Zhu accompanied him halfway home, and then they went their separate ways.\n\nWhen the scholar returned to the monastery property, monks and servants gathered around to ask him what had happened. Concealing the truth from them, he claimed, “When I said there was a ghost, I was just being facetious. In fact, I merely went over to a friend’s home for some drinks.”\n\nAfter five days, Zhu arrived, dressed up and carrying a fan, clearly very happy. As he arrived at the building’s entrance hall, he warmly paid his respects to the scholar, even from a distance. Smiling, Zhu said, “Your marriage ceremony is all arranged and to be celebrated tonight, so you should be on your way.”\n\n“Since I didn’t know if she’d agree,” said the scholar, “I haven’t yet sent the betrothal gifts, so how can I have a wedding ceremony?”\n\nZhu replied, “I’ve already had them sent.” The scholar was very touched by Zhu’s efforts, and so he left with him. They went directly to Zhu’s home, where the scholar’s niece, dressed in colorful apparel, was all smiles as she received them.\n\n“And when did you get married?” asked the scholar.\n\n“Three days ago,” she replied. The scholar then had the pearls brought out, and offered them to his niece as a wedding present.\n\nShe politely declined them three times before finally accepting them, reporting to her uncle, “I took your proposal to Jiuniang’s mother, and it made her very happy. However, she said that because she’s so aged and doddering physically, she doesn’t want Jiuniang to live far away from her once she’s married; tonight you can go and settle down in her home. There are no men in the household, so it’s fine for you to go there with my husband.” Zhu then led them on their way.\n\nAs they were almost through the village, they came to a residence with its gate open, and two women in dark green walked up the steps into the hall. Presently a voice declared, “The old lady has arrived.” There were two maidservants assisting an old woman up the steps.\n\nThe scholar was about to begin kowtowing to her when the old lady said, “I’m old and decrepit, unable to stand on ceremony, so let’s just dispense with the traditional greetings.” Then she gestured to the maidservants to bring out the wine for a big celebration.\n\nZhu then called for his servants to bring out some delicacies in tripod dishes and place them in front of the scholar; he also had others set out a jug so they could pour wine for the guests. The food that was brought out for the banquet was the same as that served in the mortal world. However, the hosts were indulging themselves, rather than urging their guests to eat and drink.\n\nWhen the banquet was over, Zhu went home. The maidservants led the scholar to his nuptial quarters, and then left. As he entered the room, Jiuniang, illuminated by wedding candles, was waiting for him. They expressed their mutual love for each other, and enjoyed all the intimacies of their passion.\n\nIt all began originally when Jiuniang’s mother was supposed to be sent to the imperial capital. Upon arriving at Jinan, however, the mother, unable to stand the hardships of the journey, died, and Jiuniang consequently also killed herself. In bed, Jiuniang told her husband all the details of these past events, so choked by sobs that she couldn’t fall asleep.\n\nThen she improvised a pair of quatrains,\n\n“The silk skirts of former days have turned to dust,\n\nIn vain I resent my karma from previous incarnations.\n\nTen years in the chilly dew, under the moon in wild, deserted sweet gum forests,\n\nUntil tonight, as I enjoy the happiness of marriage in our bridal chamber.”\n\nJiuniang continued,\n\n“In the wind and rain, the white willow marks the lonely grave—\n\nWho’d dare to think that one day I would enjoy a couple’s sweet life?\n\nIf one suddenly opens up an ornate trunk and takes a look,\n\nThe bloodstained skirts inside can still be frightening.”\n\nJust at dawn, Jiuniang urged her husband, “You should go now, without awakening the servants.” From that time forward, the scholar left at daybreak and came again at night.\n\nOne night, he asked Jiuniang, “What’s the name of this village?”\n\n“Laixia,” she replied. “The village residents are new ghosts from _Lai_yang and Qi_xia_ counties, so that’s where it gets its name.” Upon hearing this, the scholar sighed sadly. Jiuniang sorrowfully told him, “Our spirits are a thousand _li_ from our hometown, like clumps of grass blown away by the wind; mother and I feel isolated and sad. With our intimate relationship in mind, I hope that you will perform an act of great spiritual kindness and take our bones home to bury them next to the family tombs, so we can have a permanent place to rest, dead but immortal.”\n\nThe scholar promised he would do so. “People and ghosts travel different roads,” she told him, “so you shouldn’t stay around here for very long.” Then she took some silk socks and gave them to him, wiping away her tears as she urged him to leave. The scholar sadly went outside, as distressed as someone attending a funeral, with such deep sorrow in his heart that he couldn’t bear to return home.\n\nHence he went and pounded at the door of Zhu’s house. Barefooted, Zhu came out to meet him; the scholar’s niece, too, surprised by his arrival, got up out of bed, her hair all disheveled, and came out to ask him about it.\n\nThe scholar remained disconsolate for some time, then related what Jiuniang had said to him. His niece commented, “Even if aunt hadn’t spoken thus, I’ve also been thinking about that, day and night. This isn’t the mortal world, so you shouldn’t try to live here for very long.” As a result, they wept together profusely, and the scholar, trying to contain his tears, took his leave.\n\nHe went back home to sleep, only to toss and turn till dawn. He wanted to go search for Jiuniang’s grave, but he’d forgotten to ask what words were on her tombstone. As evening arrived, he went out again, but the countless thousands of graves caused him to lose the way to Jiuniang’s village, so, sighing in frustration, he went back. When he spread out the silk socks to examine them, he found that a cold wind had crumbled them to bits, scattering them like ashes, hence he packed his belongings, and returned to eastern Shandong.\n\nSix months later, the scholar still couldn’t stop thinking about Jiuniang, thus he returned to Jinan, hoping he’d have a chance to see her. The sun was already setting as he reached the city’s southern outskirts, so he stopped his cart and tied the horse to a tree, then hurried to where the victims of the uprising had been buried. Yet all he could see there were the seemingly infinite graves, side by side, blurring together into an overgrown wilderness; ghostly lights and fox cries combined to create a frightening atmosphere. Scared and grieving, he returned to where he was staying.\n\nDisappointed, he departed, and directed the horse to continue traveling to the east. After about a _li_ or so, he saw a woman in the distance walking alone in a graveyard, her appearance and bearing extremely similar to Jiuniang’s. He urged the horse quickly onward to get a closer look, and found it was indeed Jiuniang.\n\nHe climbed down to speak with her, but she kept on walking as though they didn’t know each other; when the scholar pressed on, drawing near her, the woman became so distressed that she raised up her sleeve to hide her face. As the scholar suddenly cried “Jiuniang,” she vanished into thin air.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “When Qu Yuan drowned himself in the river, his chest was filled with resentment, and his gown was saturated with his blood; when prince Shen wore a half jade to show his determination, he shed his tears and life in the sands: In ancient times, there were filial sons and loyal officials who weren’t forgiven by their lords and fathers until their deaths. How is it that though the scholar wasn’t able to give Gongsun Jiuniang’s bones a burial, her resentment wouldn’t allow him to explain why he couldn’t? What an injustice that the heart can’t just be held up and assessed for what it contains!”",

Wearing the half jade, a jade ring with “a small segment cut from it—used to indicate separation” (Mathews 239), allowed Shen a way of communicating the injustice without publicly accusing his father of malfeasance—something a filial son, even granting his father’s guilt, would never do."

        "title": "The Cricket",
        "body": "At the time of Emperor Xuande’s reign, the imperial palace enjoyed putting on cricket-fighting exhibitions, so each year crickets were collected from among the people. These insects weren’t native to Shaanxi; but there was a Huayin district magistrate who sent one to curry favor in hopes of further advancement, and when it was tried in contests with others it proved talented—hence the magistrate was given the responsibility of providing a continuing supply of them to the court.\n\nThe magistrate in turn delegated the task to local community heads. The unemployed young men put the best crickets in bamboo cages, raised their prices, and hoarded them as valuable commodities. The village officials, cunning and crafty, used the cricket mandate as a pretext to levy an oppressive head tax on the people, and even just a single cricket requirement could bankrupt many families.\n\nIn one of the villages lived Cheng Ming, who kept studying for the _xiucai_ examination, but continued to prove unsuccessful after a number of attempts. Since Cheng was neither practical nor well-spoken, a devious village official proposed him to serve as the community head, and though Cheng tried to come up with many schemes for avoiding the duty, he was unable to get out of it.\n\nBefore even a year had ended, Cheng’s limited means were completely exhausted in fulfilling his duties. When it came time to collect the tax to support expenses relating to crickets, Cheng didn’t dare solicit from all of the registered households, but he also couldn’t afford to pay for them himself, and became so depressed that he wanted to die. His wife said, “How would your dying solve anything? It’d be better for you to go out searching for crickets yourself, and hope that there’s a slim chance you might catch some.” Cheng figured she was probably right, and agreed to do so.\n\nHe went out in the mornings and didn’t return until the evenings, carrying his bamboo tubes and copper wire cages, having searched ruined walls and grass thickets, and having explored under rocks and inside burrows, yet his attempts proved futile and failed to relieve his situation; although he did catch a few crickets, they were too weak and inferior to qualify.\n\nThe magistrate was very strict about his deadline for the collection and penalized Cheng’s inefficiency; hence about ten days later, Cheng was flogged a hundred blows, till pus and blood ran down his backside and thighs, rendering him unable to go out and hunt for crickets at all. As he tossed and turned in his bed, all he could think about was committing suicide.\n\nAt that time, there arrived in the village a hunchbacked witch, who had the ability to foretell the future. Cheng’s wife took some of their money and went to consult her. She found young women and old ladies alike crowded outside the witch’s door.\n\nWhen the wife finally entered, she was ushered into a private chamber containing a curtain, in front of which an incense vessel had been set up. The people who’d come to consult the witch stuck burning incense in the tripod vessel, and then bowed twice. Standing on the other side of the curtain, gazing skyward to invoke blessings, the witch moved her lips, muttering incomprehensibly. Everyone there stood and listened respectfully.\n\nAfter a little while, from behind the curtain, a piece of paper was tossed out, reporting details about the lives and concerns of the waiting people, all of which were completely accurate. Cheng’s wife placed her money on the table in the room, burned incense, and bowed as the people ahead of her had done. In just a moment, the curtain was pulled aside, a piece of paper was pitched out and fell to the ground.\n\nShe picked it up and scrutinized it, but instead of words, it contained only a picture: a drawing of a temple and pavilions, like one would find in a monastery. Behind the base of a small hill, sitting amongst some weird rocks and a very prickly stand of thorn bushes, was a darkcolored cricket with a spotted head; beside it was a frog that seemed ready to jump. Cheng’s wife pondered the drawing, but was unable to understand it. However, the cricket was significant, so she carefully tucked it away.\n\nOnce it was concealed, she went home and showed it to Cheng. Cheng thought to himself again and again: Isn’t this trying to show me where I can catch crickets? As he meticulously examined the picture’s details, he recognized their resemblance to the Great Buddha Pavilion east of the village. Then he painfully got to his feet, supporting himself with a cane, and with the picture in hand, he left, and paid a visit to the monastery.\n\nThere, he found an ancient tomb, surrounded by dense clumps of weeds; as he walked past the tomb, he saw a mound of stones shaped like fish scales, just like those in his picture. Then among the weeds, listening carefully as he moved slowly, he scanned as though searching for a needle in the undergrowth; thoroughly focused and attentive, neither the slightest sign nor sound of a cricket escaped him.\n\nHe was still searching in the dark vegetation when a frog unexpectedly jumped up and hopped away. Cheng, startled, quickly chased after it. The frog crawled into a thicket of grass. Cheng followed, and when he parted the blades of grass to look for it, he spotted a cricket hiding there; he hastily grabbed for it, but it disappeared into a crevice in the rocks. He poked at it with a blade of grass, but it wouldn’t come out; then when he used a bamboo tube to pour some water in, the cricket finally came out.\n\nIt was extremely healthy and strong in appearance, so Cheng chased and caught it. Looking closely, he noticed its enormous body and long tail, its dark neck and golden wings; in exultant spirits, he took it home in one of his cages, and his whole family rejoiced as though Cheng had found nothing less than a priceless jade. He put the cricket into a ceramic pot and cared for it, giving it bits of crab and chestnut to eat, acting both protectively and affectionately, to keep it ready for the pending cricket levy, to satisfy the magistrate.\n\nCheng had a nine-year-old son who watched till his father wasn’t present, then went to steal a look at the cricket in the pot; but when he did so, the cricket jumped out so quickly that he couldn’t stop it, so he pounced and clutched the cricket in his hand, unwittingly smashing its legs and crushing its body. In an instant, the cricket was dead. Frightened by what he’d done, the boy sobbed and called for his mother.\n\nWhen Cheng’s wife heard what had happened, her face turned ashen as she let loose a torrent of abusive scolding: “You’ve destroyed us! You’ve brought on your own death! When your father gets home, he’s going to punish you severely!” Wailing, the boy ran outside.\n\nSoon Cheng returned home, and when he heard his wife’s words, it felt like he’d been covered in ice and snow. He angrily searched for the boy, but there was no trace of him, and they couldn’t tell where he’d gone. As Cheng approached the well, and discovered the boy’s body there, his outrage turned to grief, and he cried out at the tragic loss of his son. The husband and wife were devastated; no cooking smoke issued from their home, as they sat together silently, their lives devoid of hope.\n\nJust as the sun was setting, they went to prepare their son’s body for burial. As they drew near, it became apparent that the boy was breathing faintly. Overjoyed, they put him to bed, and by midnight he was more fully resuscitated. The parents felt cautiously relieved. However, whenever they looked at the empty cricket cages, they found their son’s breathing becoming raspy and weak, so they didn’t dare criticize him again. From dusk till dawn, they never shut their eyes as they looked after him.\n\nAs the sun began to rise in the east, Cheng lay stiffly in his bed, still preoccupied with worries. Suddenly he heard something like a cricket’s chirp outside the gate, quickly got up to investigate, and indeed there was a cricket waiting. Elated, Cheng tried to catch it. With a chirp it leaped away rapidly. He covered it with his cupped palm, but he didn’t feel anything there; when he lifted his hand to take a look, it jumped away again. He hastily pursued it, and turned towards the corner of a wall, uncertain about where it had gone.\n\nHe paced up and down, looking all around the wall, till he spotted a cricket resting on it. Paying attention to every detail, Cheng noticed that this cricket was short, small, and a reddish-black color—suddenly realizing this was not the one that he had been searching for. Cheng thought the smaller cricket to be an inferior specimen, and ignored it. Hence he walked back and forth, on his guard, looking for the other cricket he’d been chasing.\n\nThe little cricket on the wall suddenly jumped onto his sleeve, and when he looked it over, he found it to be a mole cricket, with wings like plum blossoms, a square head, and long legs; a fine cricket indeed. Pleased, he made his mind up to keep it.\n\nJust as he was about to present it at the magistrate’s office, however, he became apprehensive and feared that it might not be suitable after all, so he determined to observe how it fared in some trial bouts. There was a shiftless young man in the village who had tamed and trained a cricket that he named “Crab Shell Blue,” and in daily fights with other young men’s crickets, it invariably won. He hoarded it in hopes of making a good profit when he sold it, but because of its inflated price, no one asked to buy it.\n\nHe made his way to Cheng’s home to pay a visit. When he saw the cricket that Cheng was keeping, he covered his mouth with his hand and guffawed. Then he took out his cricket, and put it in one of Cheng’s cricket cages. Cheng observed that the cricket was impressively large, and he felt acutely embarrassed, not daring to match his cricket against it. However, the young man firmly insisted that he do so.\n\nWhen he turned to look at his cricket, he decided there was no point in protecting such a pathetic specimen, figuring it’d be better to go all out, and allow his cricket to compete as best it could. Then Cheng placed it into the ceramic pot for a fight. The little cricket crouched and didn’t move, like a real simpleton. The young man roared with laughter again.\n\nTaking some of the hairy bristles of a boar, the young man tried to provoke the little cricket, but it still wouldn’t move. The young man laughed yet again. Over and over he teased the little cricket till it flew into a rage and charged at the other, springing to the attack with a spirited chirping.\n\nInstantly, they saw the little cricket leap up, its tail spread out and its feelers extended, and straightaway bite into its enemy’s neck. The young man was quite surprised, and quickly tried to stop the contest. The little cricket looked up and gave a boastful chirp, as though it was announcing to its master that it had won. Cheng was thrilled.\n\nThen while the men were admiring the little cricket, a rooster spotted it, ran over, and proceeded to peck at it. Cheng was horrified, and cried out in alarm. As luck would have it, the rooster missed when the little cricket jumped almost a _chi_ away; the rooster resumed its pursuit, chasing the cricket, till the bird had it trapped under its claw. It happened so quickly that Cheng didn’t know what to do to rescue it, as he stamped his feet in frustration and turned pale.\n\nBefore long, he saw the rooster stretch out its neck and flail about; looking closer, he could tell that the little cricket was stationed on the rooster’s comb, biting in with all its might and refusing to let go. Cheng was all the more amazed and pleased, so he picked up the little cricket, and placed him in a bamboo cage.\n\nThe next day, he took his cricket to the magistrate. When the magistrate saw how small the cricket was, he became angry and berated Cheng. When Cheng told him all the strange things that had happened, the magistrate didn’t believe him. They tested his cricket in fights and it easily won; they also tried the little cricket against another rooster, verifying that what Cheng had said was true. The magistrate accordingly rewarded Cheng.\n\nHe in turn presented it to the provincial governor. The governor was very pleased, had it placed in a golden cricket cage, and then arranged for the little cricket, along with a report of its rare accomplishments, to be presented to the emperor.\n\nOnce inside the palace, it faced all of the crickets there—Butterfly, Mantis, Greasy Whip, Plummy Forehead—and against all odds, in every contest, the little cricket couldn’t be beaten. Whenever it heard the sounds of stringed instruments playing, it responded by dancing. This was all the more unusual.\n\nThe emperor was very happy and rewarded the provincial governor with some excellent horses and satin garments. The provincial governor didn’t forget the source of his good fortune; shortly afterward, the magistrate was praised for his “outstanding” work. The magistrate was so pleased that he exempted Cheng from any further collection service. He also prevailed upon the chief county examiner to ensure that Cheng would pass the county-level civil service examination.\n\nFrom this time forward, Cheng was treated well because of his reputation as a trainer of exceptional crickets, and he frequently received special favors from the provincial governor. In not much more than a year, he came to own a hundred _qing_ of farmland, spacious pavilions with many rafters, and a thousand head each of cattle and sheep. Whenever he traveled on a journey, Cheng’s furs and horses signified that he came from an affluent family.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The emperor may on occasion desire something that afterwards he may forget about altogether; but his servants treat it as a necessity. Add pressure from officials and greedy minor functionaries, and men daily prove ready to barter their wives and to sell their sons without hesitation. That’s how a single action by the emperor influences the lives or deaths of the people, which is an important fact that cannot be ignored.\n\n“Somehow on his own, Cheng’s son became a cricket to solve their poverty, and as that cricket, he brought them impressive wealth. When Cheng was made the community head and punished by his superiors, could he have imagined that he might one day have this sumptuous life? Heaven rewarded this honest man by giving him good fortune, and thus the local official and district magistrate were all able to enjoy the privileges brought by the cricket. I’ve heard that when a man becomes an immortal, the celestials may appear even to his chickens and dogs. Put your faith in it!”",

The Yishui district magistrate became quite worried about it. As the magistrate went to his official residence and laid down to sleep, he dreamed that a _xiucai_ came to see him, dressed in an official’s cap and green clothing, appearing as a man of large stature. He told the magistrate that he knew how to solve the problem.\n\nThe magistrate asked him about this, and the _xiucai_ told him, “Tomorrow on the southwest road out of the county, there’ll be a woman straddling a large-bellied female donkey—the woman’s a spirit, the goddess of locusts. If you pray solemnly to her, your county can be protected from disaster.” The magistrate woke up, and thinking how unusual this was, he prepared some food and drink, then headed south out of the county.\n\nHe’d been waiting for a long while, when a woman appeared, her hair piled up high in a coil, wearing brown clothing and a short cape. Alone except for an old servant leading her donkey, she was making her way northward, slowly and with difficulty. As she approached, the magistrate lit some incense, held up a wine vessel with both hands to welcome her respectfully from the side of the road, and then held onto her donkey so she couldn’t leave.\n\n“Your honor, what are you doing?” the woman asked.\n\nThe magistrate solemnly replied, “I have a small county to govern, and if you can spare us from suffering disaster caused by the locusts, it would be our great fortune.”\n\nThe woman exclaimed, “That hateful _xiucai_ Liu’s been shooting off his mouth again, blabbing all my plans! Now I’ll make _him_ the target of my intentions, instead of destroying your crops and fields.” Then she drained three pourings of wine, and disappeared.\n\nLater, when the locusts arrived, though the sky quickly grew overcast, none of them fell on the crops in the fields; instead, they attacked only the branches of willow trees, stripping them entirely of willow leaves wherever they passed.\n\nThat’s when the magistrate realized that _xiucai_ Liu was the willow god.

On June 18, a heavy rain fell, and the ground became sufficiently moist that some people started to plant soy beans.\n\nOne day, there was an old man in Shimen village who at dusk saw a pair of oxen fighting atop a hill, and told the other villagers, “A flood is coming!” Then he took his family and relocated them elsewhere. The villagers all laughed at this. Before long, the rain came down in a violent deluge and didn’t stop all night long, till water covered the earth to a depth of several _chi_ and the houses were nearly submerged.\n\nOne farmer had to abandon his two sons while he and his wife helped his elderly mother hurry to higher ground. By the time he looked back down at Shimen village from above, the area was already inundated, and there was nothing he could do for his sons. Once the waters receded, he returned to his home and saw that the ruined village now looked almost like a burial ground.\n\nWhen he entered his own door and looked around, he could see that a single room in his house had somehow survived, and his two sons were sitting on a bed, laughing and playing, safe and sound. Everyone said that the boys were spared because the husband and wife had performed their filial duty. This took place on June 22.\n\nDuring the thirty-fourth year of the reign of Kangxi, Pingyang experienced an earthquake, and seventy to eighty percent of the people there died.

Presently, he heard the sound of boots walking, and a gray-headed old man appeared, wearing a black hat and black belt. This seemed strange, so Zhang asked him who he was. The old man kowtowed, and replied, “I’m the storehouse official. I’ve been supervising your excellency’s holdings for quite some time. Fortunately, now that you’ve arrived, I can be released from this heavy burden.”\n\n“How much does it come to?” asked Zhang.\n\nThe old man replied, “23,500 taels.”\n\nZhang reasoned that transporting so much silver would be a real encumbrance on his journey, so he arranged to take ownership of it on his return trip.

All of the instruments of torture that were kept there, were forged by human beings. Whenever the shackles became worn out from use, they were tossed aside at the mouth of the cave, and the county magistrate would exchange them with new ones, which would be taken away overnight. The costs of providing these supplies were added into the county’s tax levies.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, there was an imperial censor named Hua Gong, who came to Fengdu on official business, and couldn’t believe it when he heard what people were saying about the cave, so he wanted to enter it to check for himself. People tried to tell him he shouldn’t do it. But Hua wouldn’t listen, so with candles in hand, he entered, accompanied by two office aides.\n\nWhen they had progressed about a _li_ or so through the darkness, the candles suddenly went out. Looking around, they found a broad, shining set of stairs leading to a series of over ten vast halls, and sitting next to each other were a group of senior officials, wearing their robes of office and holding their tablets solemnly; but there was one empty seat at the eastern end of the row. When the officials saw Hua enter, they came down the stairs to welcome him, smiling as they asked, “So you’ve come, eh? Have you been in good health since we last parted?”\n\n“What is this place?” Hua asked them.\n\nThe officials replied, “This is the underworld.” Startled, Hua told them he needed to leave. The officials pointed to the empty chair, and said, “This is your seat, so you can no longer return.” Hua became quite frightened, and pleaded with them to let him leave. The officials exclaimed, “How can you escape what’s already fated!”\n\nThen they consulted a document with instructions regarding Hua, the notes in which reported, “On a certain day, this certain corporeal body will return to the underworld.” When Hua read this, he began shivering like he’d been drenched in ice water. As he thought of his aged mother and son, who needed him, his tears began to fall.\n\nSuddenly an armored god appeared, carrying a yellow silk proclamation in both hands. The officials bowed respectfully, the document was opened and they read its contents, then they congratulated Hua, saying, “You have a chance to return to life.” Hua was elated, and asked why he was to be allowed to return. They replied, “It’s because of this edict from the Hell King, offering a general pardon for the spirits in the underworld, so now you can disregard the original ruling.” Then they showed Hua the way home, and he left.\n\nOnce he’d gone several steps, the darkness became as black as lacquer and he couldn’t make out where to turn. Hua felt quite disoriented and troubled. Suddenly a celestial general appeared, towering over Hua as he approached with his ruddy face and long beard, emitting a brilliant light for several _chi_ all around him. Hua respectfully greeted him, and explained his sorrowful plight.\n\nThe general told him, “Just chant the Buddhist sutras and you’ll be able to find a way out.” When his words were finished, the general departed. Hua realized that he didn’t remember most of the Buddhist holy sutras, and had only studied the Diamond Sutra with any care before, so he placed his palms together and began chanting, till all of a sudden he sensed a thin beam of light shining and showing him the way out.\n\nBut just then he forgot a phrase from the sutra, and immediately it became dark again; when after a few moments he was able to think of it, he resumed chanting and the light returned.

His family wasn’t particularly well off, and he was ill-fortuned, so even though he was over twenty, he still hadn’t passed the civil service examination at the county level.\n\nIt was an unpleasant custom in the area that families were forced to become county heads, to make up shortfalls in the official tax revenues, though even the rich families couldn’t afford the task and were bankrupted. When Wan was obliged to fulfill the obligation, in fear he ran away to Jinan, and paid to stay at an inn.\n\nThat night, a strikingly beautiful young woman came to see him. Delighted, Wan made love with her, then asked her for her name. She told him, “Truthfully, I’m a fox, but I won’t cause you any harm.” Wan was happy to hear this, and didn’t worry about it at all. The young woman urged him not to allow any other guests to share his room, and at the end of each day she came and slept with him there. She also provided him with whatever else he needed, so he became dependent on the fox.\n\nSoon, two or three of Wan’s new acquaintances showed up to visit him, and stayed two nights, but then wouldn’t leave. Wan was fed up with them, but he couldn’t bring himself to throw them out; he had no alternative but to tell his guests the truth. The visitors wanted him to let them see the fox woman. Wan relayed this to her.\n\nThe fox asked his guests, “Why do you want to see me? I look just like people do.” They heard her mellifluous voice as if she was standing in front of them, but when they peered around, they couldn’t see her.\n\nOne man among Wan’s visitors, named Sun Deyan, an adept practical joker, demanded insistently that she appear: “You’ve let us hear your lovely voice, seductively teasing us; why stingily withhold your beauty from us after getting us so excited?”\n\nThe fox laughed and replied, “What a virtuous grandson! Are you going to paint a nice picture for your grandmother?” The others all joined her in laughing at Sun. “I’m a fox,” she told them, “so if I offer to tell you a fox tale, may I hope that you’ll listen to it?” The group eagerly assured her they would do so.\n\n“In the olden days,” she said, “there was a certain village inn that was beset by many foxes, who mischievously haunted the guests there. Travelers knew about this, and warned each other against staying at that inn, till after half a year the place was absolutely deserted. The innkeeper was greatly worried, so much so that he wouldn’t even talk about the foxes.\n\n“Suddenly a traveler from far away spotted the inn and stopped, identifying himself as a foreigner. The innkeeper was overjoyed. He invited the traveler to enter his gate, but another person passing by privately told him, ‘There are foxes in that inn.’ The foreigner informed the innkeeper that he wanted to stay somewhere else if there were foxes around. The innkeeper insisted that he was being silly, so the man finally agreed to stay.\n\n“When he entered his room and laid down, he witnessed a pack of rats run out from under his bed. The guest, who was quite startled, frantically cried out, ‘It’s the foxes!’ The surprised innkeeper asked what was wrong. ‘There’s a den of foxes in this place,’ said the indignant guest, ‘so why’d you lie to me that there weren’t any?’\n\n“The innkeeper then asked, ‘So what form did they take?’\n\n“‘I saw them just now,’ the foreigner replied, ‘and they may have been pretty small, but if they weren’t the sons of foxes, then they were certainly their grandsons!’” As she finished speaking, the seated visitors all laughed appreciatively.\n\nSun remarked, “Since you’re not going to allow us to see you, we’ll just have to stay here tonight rather than leaving, which should put quite a crimp in your lovemaking plans.”\n\nThe fox laughed, and replied, “There’s no harm in you staying here tonight; but if I pull a small trick of my own, I hope you won’t mind.” The visitors were afraid she might play some prank on them, so they all ran off together.\n\nHowever, they came back every few days to taunt and laugh at the fox. She was very even-tempered about it, and every time she said something, she turned the guests upside down with laughter, her jokes making it difficult for some of them to straighten up, thanks to all their laughing. The grouped jokingly referred to her as “Lady Fox.”\n\nOne day, Wan put on a banquet for them, occupying the host’s position, with Sun and two others sitting on either side of him, while a couch was set up for the fox woman. She declined to take part in the drinking. They all begged her to sit and chat with them, so she agreed.\n\nWhen the wine had gone around several times, they began throwing dice to play a drinking game called “Melon Vine.” One of the guests, who’d rolled a “melon” and had to take a drink, playfully pushed the drinking cup over to where the fox was sitting and said, “Lady Fox is completely sober, so maybe she’ll have a cup.”\n\nLaughing, the fox replied, “I simply don’t drink. But if you’d like, I can tell you a story while you gentlemen continue drinking.” Sun covered his ears, not wanting to listen.\n\nThe other guests told her, “If you say anything abusive, you’ll have to take a drink as punishment.”\n\n“What about directing the abuse at a fox?” she laughed.\n\n“That’s fine,” they said. Consequently they gave her their attention and listened.\n\n“There was once a high official,” she said, “who was sent on a diplomatic mission to a foreign country, and wearing a fox-fur hat, he went to see the country’s king. When the king observed his hat, he asked, ‘What kind of fur is that, so warm and luxurious?’ The high official told him it was fox.\n\n“The king said, ‘I’ve never heard of it before in my life. What’s the character for “fox” look like?’\n\n“The diplomatic official drew the character in the air, and then explained to the king, ‘On the right side of the character there’s a big melon, while on the left side there’s a little dog.’” Wan’s guests once again burst into laughter.\n\nTwo of them were brothers named Chen, Chen Suojian and Chen Suowen. Having seen Sun so embarrassed, the two now said to Wan, “Where’s the male fox who lets his mate carry on maliciously like this?’\n\nThe fox answered them, “I was telling a story and wasn’t done when all this barking interrupted me, so please let me finish. The king noticed that the high official was riding a mule, and thought it very odd. The official explained to him, ‘Its parents were horses.’ This seemed even more odd to the king. ‘In China,’ the official told him, ‘horses can give birth to mules, and mules can give birth to jujus.’ The king asked him for more details.\n\n“The official replied, ‘The horse giving birth to a mule was “what I saw”; the mule giving birth to a juju is “what I heard”.’” All those present again guffawed with rollicking laughter. The guests knew they were not her equals in wit, so all of them agreed that afterwards, the first one to make fun of the others would be punished by having to host a dinner for them.\n\nA little later, when the drinking was at its height, Sun teased Wan, “Here’s the first part of a poem—please offer a second line to join with it.”\n\n“What is it?” his host asked.\n\nSun declared, “A prostitute goes out the gate to visit her lover—when she arrives she makes a ‘curtsy,’ and when she leaves she makes a ‘curtsy’.” The others seated there thought and thought, but couldn’t come up with anything.\n\nThen the fox laughed and said, “I have it.” The others all listened carefully. She recited, “The dragon king issued an edict soliciting direct advice, so the turtle can ‘offer some words’ and the tortoise can also ‘offer some words.’” Those present couldn’t help but roar with laughter.\n\nSun, frustrated and embarrassed, exclaimed, “You swore an oath to our agreement earlier, so why have you deliberately forfeited?”\n\nLaughing, the fox replied, “The penalty certainly falls to me; however, if I hadn’t answered, the couplet would have been left incomplete. Tomorrow we’ll hold the dinner, and then I’ll settle my debt.” They all laughed together and parted. There simply aren’t enough words to describe the unique humor of this fox.\n\nA few months later, Wan and the fox woman returned to his home. As they approached the border of Boxing, she told Wan, “I have some distant relatives here whom I haven’t been able to contact in a long time, so I must get a message to them. It’s also getting late in the day, but if we stay with them tonight, we can wait till morning, and then continue on.” Wan asked her where the place was, and she pointed as she said, “Not far.” Wan was skeptical, since there were no villages in the vicinity, but he went along with her anyway.\n\nAbout two _li_ further, they saw a village that Wan had never visited before. The fox went and knocked at a door, and an old servant came out to answer it. When they entered, they discovered a series of pavilions, seemingly identifying it as the home of an affluent family. Presently they met their hosts, an elderly man and woman, who greeted Wan deferentially, and invited him to sit down. They provided a sumptuous feast, treating Wan like he was their son-in-law, and so the couple stayed there that night.\n\nIn the morning, the fox told Wan, “I’m worried that when we return to your home, people will be frightened when they hear me speaking invisibly. You should go first and tell them about me, and then I’ll follow you later.”\n\nWan went on ahead as she suggested, and told his family members everything. Soon the fox arrived, talking and laughing with Wan, and though people could hear her voice, they couldn’t see anyone there.\n\nA year went by, and Wan once again had business in Jinan, so the fox accompanied him there. Suddenly several people showed up there, and the fox stepped aside to speak with them, appearing to exchange warm greetings with the visitors. Then she returned, and informed Wan, “I’m originally from Shanxi, and because it was meant to be, I’ve been with you for a time. Now my brothers have come for me and I must return home with them, so I can no longer stay with you as your wife.”\n\nWan begged her to stay, but she couldn’t, and departed forever.",

There came a knock at the door, and when he opened it to look out, he found a white-haired man, dressed in an archaically elegant style. The scholar invited him in, and politely asked him his name. The old man informed him, “I’m called Yangzhen, Hu Yangzhen, and the truth is that I’m a fox immortal. I admire your refined mind very highly, and I hope we can become close friends.” The _xiucai_, who was a carefree individual, didn’t find this at all worrisome.\n\nThey discussed the accuracy of ideas both modern and ancient. The old man was particularly learned on many subjects, accomplished in writing, articulate in speech, and elegant in conversation; at times, he’d address the true meanings of the classics, with profound reasoning that the scholar felt was beyond human comprehension. Overawed, the _xiucai_ asked him to stay for a long time.\n\nOne day, he confidentially implored the old man, “You’ve become very fond of me. Seeing as how I’m so poor, you could simply gesture with your hand and money would appear for me at once. Why not give me a little?” The old man was silent, as though resistant to doing so.\n\nAfter a little while, he smiled and said, “This would be a very easy matter. However, you’ll have to give me ten coins or so, to get things started.” The scholar complied with his request. Then the old man went with him into a private room, where he began reciting magical incantations.\n\nIn moments, millions of coins began falling, tinkling off the roof beam like a sudden rainstorm, and in a flash the men were up to their knees in them; by the time they could pull their feet free and stand up on the coins, they were already covered up to their ankles. Over the expanse of the _zhang_-long room, the coins were already stacked up to a depth of three or four _chi_.\n\nThe old man looked at the _xiucai_, and asked, “Is that sufficient for you?”\n\n“It’s enough,” replied the scholar.\n\nThe old man waved his hand, and the coins immediately stopped falling. Then together they bolted the door and left. The _xiucai_ was privately overjoyed, for he had suddenly become rich.\n\nA bit later, when he entered to take some of the money for his use, the room formerly filled with money now contained nothing but the original ten or so coins—all that remained in the otherwise empty room. The disappointed _xiucai_ exploded in rage at the old man, resenting his lies.\n\nThe old man responded angrily, “I originally took you to be a friend who shared the love of literature, not someone who simply wanted me to be a thief for him! It might be handier for you if you only look for burglars to make friends with, since I can’t comply with your wishes!” Then he brushed off his clothing disapprovingly, and left.",

        "body": "A high-ranking family living in an out-of-theway place in western Yidu was so rich that there were enormous sums of money kept in the household, and the master had a concubine who was quite exquisite. But his wife hurled humiliating insults at her, and beat her without any reason for doing so. Nevertheless, the concubine served respectfully and sincerely in all matters. The master sympathized with her, and often spoke privately to comfort her. Yet the concubine never made any complaints.\n\nOne night, a few dozen men climbed over their wall to get in, using stools and bricks to strike at—and nearly to break open—the house’s doors. The master and his wife were scared out of their wits, shivering and shaking, not knowing what they should do. The concubine got up without making so much as the sound of a breath, groped her way through the house in the dark till she found a carrying-pole to use as a weapon, pulled open the door, and rushed out.\n\nThe band of thieves were thrown into confusion, disheveled and shocked. The concubine brandished the pole adroitly, making a high-pitched noise with it as its two iron hooks whipped through the air, and then knocked four or five of the men to the ground; utterly at a loss, the flabbergasted thieves ran madly for the wall, too frantic to be able to climb over, so they just leaned against it, and flopped down, wailing, like a group of lost souls.\n\nThe concubine stuck the carrying pole in the ground, looked at them with a laugh, and said, “You sorry things aren’t even worth giving a beating—you don’t even know how to be thieves! I’m not going to kill you, because killing the likes of you would only disgrace me.” They all leapt up to escape.\n\nThe master, dumbfounded, asked the concubine, “How were you able to do that?” It turned out that the concubine’s father had been a master of the spear and staff, so she had learned all of his martial skills, and hence she couldn’t be stopped by less than a hundred opponents.\n\nThe master’s wife, who had been really terrified, regretted that she’d allowed the concubine’s appearance to distract her from trying to learn more about her. From this time forward, she was considerably more friendly to the concubine. And the concubine, for her part, never showed the least bit of disrespect, or violated any etiquette, towards the wife.\n\nSome of the neighbor women said to her, “You thrashed those thieves like they were pigs and dogs, so why’d you just lower your head and accept your painful beatings before?”\n\n“It was my duty,” replied the concubine, “so there was nothing for me to say.” Hearing this, they thought her even more virtuous.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “She was a consummate weapons master, but for several years no one in the household knew this, and in the end she fended off disaster and drove away calamity, transforming the wife from a hawk into a dove. That’s something! A sure way to make a wife smile is to bring home a pheasant one’s shot; and not until a princess’ husband wins a spear from a rival while gambling, will the princess let him ride in the same coach with her. One must never take one’s skills for granted and stop practicing—this is the reason!”",

        "body": "Xu Yuangong, who lived in Changshan, was a _zhusheng_ during the late Ming period. After the dynasty shift to the Qing, he abandoned Confucianism to pursue Daoism, gradually mastering some elements of Daoist magic, till his name became known far and near.\n\nIn a certain city there was a big official who had plenty of money; one day he wrote Xu a sincere letter, and sent a servant on horseback to invite Xu to come and visit him. “Why is he summoning me?” asked Xu.\n\nThe servant replied, “I don’t know. I only know that I was ordered to make sure that you came along.” Xu then left with him.\n\nThey arrived at a courtyard where a banquet had been prepared, and Xu was ceremoniously greeted with great respect; however, there was still no explanation of the reason why he’d been sent for and received this way. When Xu could take it no longer, he asked the official, “What do you really want? I’d appreciate it, if you’d clear this up.”\n\nHis host kept answering, “Nothing special.” Instead, he encouraged Xu to have more wine. The host’s words were evasive, offering nothing to help Xu understand what was going on. They talked for such a long time that they were unaware dusk had arrived. The official invited Xu to have a drink in his garden.\n\nThe garden was quite beautifully and effectively constructed, with bamboo planted to provide a screen of privacy, shaded landscape, varieties of wildflowers grouped together, and half of it covered by grass. They came to a pavilion where the wooden plaque above its entrance had spiders suspended from it, of all sizes and kinds, too many to count them.\n\nAfter several rounds of wine, the twilight sky darkened, and the official ordered the servants to bring out candles and more to drink. Xu told him he couldn’t handle any more wine, so his host stopped pouring wine and called for tea.\n\nThe servants hastily removed their dishes and utensils, and put them on a small table in the left-side alcove of the pavilion. When they hadn’t yet sipped even half of their tea, the official gave an excuse for having to leave. A servant then brought a candle to guide Xu to where he could stay overnight. He placed the candle on a table, then quickly turned around and left in a considerable rush.\n\nXu suspected that the servant might go fetch his bag and bring it to him soon, and for a long time after the servant left, he couldn’t hear any sounds of people. Then he finally got up, fastened the bolt on the door, and laid back down to sleep. The moon, shining brightly outside his window, entered the room and spilled over his bed; night birds and autumn insects chirped briefly. Xu felt so unnerved that he couldn’t get to sleep.\n\nAn instant later, he heard footfalls, like the sound of someone stomping something very violently. One moment they were below, near the handrail to the pavilion’s stairs, and the next moment they were near the door of his room. The terrified Xu’s hair stood on end like a hedgehog’s, and he immediately pulled his blanket over his head, as the door opened suddenly.\n\nXu held up a corner of the blanket and peered out from it, as a creature came in with the head of a beast and the body of a human being; all over its body, it had dark, black-colored hair, as long as a horse’s mane; its teeth stuck out like jagged mountain peaks, its eyes blazed like a pair of torches.\n\nWhen it was nearly at his bed, it bent down to lick out all of the leftover dishes from the feast; when it had finished with its tongue, it ate everything on the tables, including the dishes. Then it came close to Xu’s bed, sniffing at his blanket.\n\nXu suddenly leapt up, throwing the blanket over the monster’s head, holding it on while crying madly for help. The monster was totally unprepared for this—frightened, and trying to tear the blanket off, it opened the outside door and fled. Xu wrapped his own clothes around his shoulders and also hurried to escape, but found the door outside the garden bolted, so he couldn’t get out through there.\n\nHe walked next to the wall, choosing a low spot in it to climb over, and there he came to the official’s stable. He startled the stableman; after Xu told him what had happened, the stableman provided him with a place to stay for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst thing the next morning, the official sent a servant to wait upon Xu, and when he learned that Xu wasn’t where they’d left him, he became very agitated. Finally they found him in the stable. Xu came out, extremely outraged, and angrily exclaimed, “I’m not accustomed to driving out monsters with my magic; you sent for me, then remained cryptic, without a word of explanation; my bag has an iron hook in it which I could have used to climb over the wall, but you kept the bag from me: I could’ve died!”\n\nThe official expressed his gratitude by saying, “I intended to tell you, but then I worried that you might refuse me. I also didn’t know you’d have an iron hook in your bag. I hope you can forgive my serious offense!” Xu, disgruntled by the whole affair, sought a ride home.\n\nFrom then on, the monster stopped showing up. When the official set up a banquet in his garden, he smiled at his guests as he declared, “I’ll never forget scholar Xu’s help!”\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “‘Yellow cat or black cat, whichever catches the rat is the good one.’ These certainly aren’t just empty words. If, after Xu had thrown the blanket over the monster’s head, he had hidden his terror and boldly claimed that it was his talent that had driven off the monster, then the world certainly might say that scholar Xu did what even an immortal might not have succeeded in doing.”",

        "body": "Minister of State Mao came from an impoverished family in Yexian. When he was young, his father often tended cattle for other people. An affluent family named Zhang lived in the same county, and had recently constructed a new gravesite on the south side of East Mountain. As someone from the Zhang family happened to walk past it, they heard a voice call out from the grave: “You need to get away from here as quickly as possible—you can’t occupy the high official’s graveyard!” When Master Zhang heard about this, he didn’t believe it.\n\nThen he began having frequent dreams in which he was warned, “Your family’s burial ground is on the site of the Mao family’s tomb, so how long do you think you can go on using it?” Following this, his family experienced a series of mishaps. People advised Zhang to move the burial plot to a more auspicious spot, and after listening to their suggestions, he did so.\n\nOne day, as Mao’s father was herding cattle, he came upon the Zhang family’s abandoned gravesite, and it abruptly started to rain, so he took shelter in the empty grave. Shortly afterwards, the rain turned into a cloudburst and roaring floodwaters poured into the grave, drowning the cowherd.\n\nMao at the time was still a child. His mother went to see Zhang, to beg him for a plot where she could bury her husband. When Zhang asked to know her husband’s surname, he was shocked to learn it was Mao. Zhang went to see the place where the cowherd had drowned, discovered that it was where he had previously interred a family coffin, and feeling even more shaken, he gave permission for Mao’s father to be buried there. In addition, he asked the widow to bring her son to see him the next time she came.\n\nFollowing the burial, Mao’s mother brought him to thank Zhang. Zhang took one look at Mao and was immediately delighted, inviting him into his home, where Mao was taught to read, and was treated like a member of Zhang’s family.\n\nMoreover, in time Zhang offered his eldest daughter to Mao to be his wife. Mao’s mother didn’t dare accept the offer. “Since we’ve already given our word,” Zhang’s wife told her, “nothing can happen to change that!” Finally, Mao’s mother accepted the proposal.\n\nHowever, this daughter thought very little of the Mao family, her resentment and shame apparent in both her words and her looks. If someone happened to say something about the pending marriage, she’d cover her ears; she was always telling people, “I’ll die, rather than marry a cowherd’s son!”\n\nWhen the day for the ceremony arrived, the bridegroom entered the banquet room, with the bridal sedan chair waiting outside the gate, but Zhang’s daughter sat in a corner of her room, with her sleeve over her face, crying. People pressed her to get ready, but she refused; when they tried to persuade her otherwise, she adamantly resisted.\n\nAfter a while, the bridegroom announced that he was ready to go, so the couple’s musical accompaniment was cued to begin playing, but the daughter was still bawling, her hair all disheveled. Zhang stopped his son-in-law, and went into his daughter’s room himself, where she continued sobbing and wouldn’t listen to him. Zhang became angry and tried to force her to get ready, but she just cried herself hoarse. The father was at a loss about what to do.\n\nJust then a servant brought word to Zhang that Mao was waiting to leave. The father anxiously came out and told the bridegroom, “The bride isn’t finished getting ready, so she begs you to wait a bit longer.” Then he rushed back to look in on his daughter. He frantically came and went without ceasing. As time moved toward the end of the delay he’d requested, he became more and more anxious about the matter, but his daughter absolutely refused to cooperate. The poor father had no solution, and wished to kill himself, just to be done with it.\n\nHis youngest daughter was at his side, quite disapproving of her sister’s behavior, and tried very hard to persuade her to do as their father had asked. The elder sister angrily exclaimed, “So, little girl, you’ve become a blabbermouth like all the others! Why don’t you just marry him yourself?”\n\nThe younger sister replied, “Papa didn’t offer me to Master Mao; if he had, would you have to go to all the bother of trying to persuade me?” Zhang took in his younger daughter’s forthright words, and then privately conferred with his wife about exchanging the younger daughter for the elder.\n\nThe mother turned to her younger daughter, and said, “Your recalcitrant sister refuses to obey her parents’ orders, so now we want you to take her place—are you willing to do so?”\n\nWithout any hesitation, the daughter answered them, “If you want me to go with him, I wouldn’t dare decline, even if he were a beggar; besides, who says that Master Mao’s going to die a poor man?” When her parents heard her words, they were very happy, and helped her into her sister’s wedding gown, then hastily guided her into the sedan chair, and sent her on her way.\n\nThe newlywed couple lived in perfect harmony and mutual understanding. Yet Mao’s wife suffered from an unusual thinning of the hair, and this occasionally bothered him. Gradually, however, he learned about the sisters’ exchange, and became even more appreciative of his wife’s virtue.\n\nSoon Mao passed the county level imperial examination to become a _xiucai_, qualifying him to take the provincial level examination. On his way, he came to an inn at a village called Wangsheren, where the innkeeper had had a dream the previous night in which a god told him, “Tomorrow a _jieyuan_ named Mao will arrive, and later he will help you out of a difficult situation.” Therefore the innkeeper had risen especially early that morning, so he could wait there and watch to the east for his guest to arrive. So when Mao finally approached, he was very pleased.\n\nThe innkeeper prepared every conceivable amenity for his guest, and asked for nothing in return. He also made sure to tell Mao about the dream prophecy’s promise of support. Mao began to feel quite self-important; he secretly kept thinking about his wife’s thinning hair, and worried that important people would laugh at him because of her, so he figured that he should exchange her for another wife, once he achieved wealth and rank.\n\nNot long after this, when the official list of successful civil service examinees was posted publicly, Mao learned that he had failed—with an irritated sigh, he stumbled away, his ambitions all lost to him. Too embarrassed to face the innkeeper, Mao didn’t dare return to the inn, so instead he just took another way home.\n\nThree years later, Mao returned to take the provincial level examination again, and the innkeeper treated him just as cordially as before. “The words of your dream didn’t come true,” said Mao, “so I feel ashamed to accept your hospitality.”\n\nThe innkeeper replied, “You wanted to exchange your wife, and that’s why an underworld official took your name off the list of successful candidates, so doesn’t it have something to do with that dream?” Mao was amazed, and asked the innkeeper how the man knew what he’d been thinking. The innkeeper explained that after Mao had left the last time, he’d had another dream, and that was what he’d been told in it.\n\nWhen Mao heard this, he became frightened, and repented his thoughts, standing there numbly like a statue. The innkeeper told him, “You should have more consideration for your behavior, and then you’ll become a _jieyuan_ again.” Not long afterwards, Mao received the highest score in the provincial examinations, and became a _juren_. His wife’s hair also began to grow thicker and darker, till she became even more attractive than she was before.\n\nThe elder Zhang sister married the son of a rich family, and hence became insufferably proud of herself. Her husband proved to be a lazy loafer, so the family’s fortunes decayed, until the house was emptied of furnishings, and there was no food left to eat. When the elder sister heard that her younger sister was the wife of a _juren_, she felt utterly ashamed.\n\nThe sisters always avoided each other in public. Then, before long, the elder’s husband died, and her family really collapsed. A little later, Mao succeeded in becoming a _jinshi_. When she heard this, the elder sister experienced a deep-rooted self-loathing, and angrily rejecting the life she’d been leading, she became a Buddhist nun.\n\nAfter he’d been named Minister of State, Mao returned home, and the elder sister dispatched a novice to go visit Mao with polite greetings, in hopes of receiving some sort of donation from him. When the novice arrived, Mao’s wife presented her with bolts of patterned silk, into which she’d rolled up silver taels, though the novice wasn’t aware of what she’d done.\n\nShe took the bolts home to the elder sister. Disappointed with them, the sister hatefully said, “If she’d given me money, I could spend it on firewood and rice; but what am I supposed to do with these!” Then she ordered the novice to take them back.\n\nMao and his wife were baffled. When they unrolled the silk bolts and found the taels still there, they realized why the sister had refused them. Taking out the taels, Mao laughed as he told the novice, “Your teacher had a hundred taels wrapped in silk, but wasn’t able to enjoy them, so she couldn’t very well have the fortune to be married to a high official.” Then he took fifty of the taels and gave them to the novice, saying, “Take these back to your teacher to cover her expenses. I fear that an illfortuned person like her is simply fated not to have any greater amount of money.”\n\nThe novice left, and returned to the convent, reporting everything she’d been told. The elder sister had nothing to say, and sighed to herself, thinking over her life and the way she’d behaved, how she had always gotten everything backward, shunning the good and choosing what was bad; but who else could be blamed for that?\n\nThe innkeeper after this was arrested for murder and sent to prison, but Mao worked on his behalf to prove him innocent of the crime.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “The Zhang family tomb became the grave for Mao’s father—this was already a strange matter. I’ve heard the tale of an ‘elder sister’s husband becoming a younger sister’s husband, and a former _jieyuan_ later becoming a _jieyuan_ once again,’ but could even a clever thinker imagine that such things could actually happen? Alas! The ways of heaven cannot be known—so why, then, when it came to Minister Mao, was everything so accurately predicted?”",

        "body": "A Fujian man named Zeng, who’d previously qualified as a _juren_, and had just finished scoring highly in the imperial examination held at the southern palace, went with two or three other successful examinees for an excursion through the outskirts of the provincial capital. They’d overheard that there was an astrologer staying at Pilu Temple, so they joined together to ride out there for a visit to have their fortunes told.\n\nWhen they entered the temple, they bowed respectfully, and then sat down. The astrologer noticed their self-congratulatory attitude and decided to flatter them a bit. Zeng, smirking as he waved a small fan, asked, “Am I fated to receive the python robe and jade emblem of high authority?”\n\nWith a straight face, the astrologer told him that for about twenty years, he would serve in peace and tranquility as prime minister. Zeng was absolutely delighted, and his attitude became even more smug. A small rainstorm happened along just then, so Zeng and his companions ran to take shelter in the monks’ quarters.\n\nOnce they were inside, an old monk, with deep-set eyes and a long nose, sitting on a cushion made from rushes, took no notice of them, and offered them no greetings. The group raised their hands to say hello, then sat down on the monks’ beds to chat among themselves, congratulating Zeng on being told that he would become prime minister.\n\nIncreasingly full of himself, Zeng told his fellows, “When I become prime minister, I shall promote my classmate Zhang’s father, to serve as governor of the southern provinces, while my cousins will be made generals, and my old servant will be named a tax transport leader—and then I will be satisfied.” From their seats, the others roared with laughter.\n\nSince they could hear the rain beginning to come down much heavier outside, Zeng, feeling tired, lay down on the bed where he was sitting. In moments, he saw two palace messengers, who were carrying an edict written by the emperor himself, summoning Zeng to advise him on matters of national importance. Puffed up with pride, Zeng hurried to court.\n\nThere, the emperor sat on the edge of his seat, listening attentively to Zeng’s words for a long time. He decreed then that Zeng was empowered to demote or to promote any official of the third level or lower. Afterwards the emperor bestowed him with a python robe, a jade emblem, and a thoroughbred horse. Zeng put on the robe, prostrating himself, and bowing ingratiatingly, then left.\n\nWhen he got home, he found his residence no longer as it had previously been, for the pillars were all painted, and the rafters engraved to magnificent effect. Zeng didn’t understand how everything could have been done so quickly. And when he merely stroked his beard and made a small utterance, there was a thunderous clamor of yes-men agreeing with him.\n\nPresently, high-ranking officials, fawning and toadying, dropped by to present him with piles of imported gifts. The flatterers waiting for him gathered outside his gate, but when the country’s six highest officials came, Zeng rushed out to welcome them, his shoes all askew, and when middle-level officials arrived, he bowed respectfully to greet them; but he merely nodded to all the lower-ranking officials.\n\nThe governor of Shanxi presented him with ten female musicians, each of them quite lovely. He particularly favored the beautiful Niaoniao and Xianxian, so he pampered the two of them. Whenever he was taking it easy at home, he didn’t wear his cap of office, and he dressed casually, while the women sang songs all day long.\n\nOne day, Zeng was thinking back to when he was still poor, no one of importance, and a gentleman named Wang Ziliang helped him out—now that I’ve secured a high position for myself, he reasoned, while Wang’s still struggling to become an official, why not lend him a hand? Early the next day, he submitted a document recommending that Wang become an imperial advisor, so the emperor approved an edict for Wang to be promoted immediately to the new post.\n\nThen Zeng recalled how Imperial Chamberlain Guo had once given him a dirty look, so he sent for Advisor Lu, Censor Chen Chang, and others, informing them of his desires in the matter, and by the following day, an impeachment order was delivered, decreeing that Guo be removed from office, and forced to leave. To be able to settle his old debts and grudges made Zeng very happy indeed.\n\nOn a certain occasion, as he was traveling along a thoroughfare out in the countryside, a drunk accosted Zeng’s procession, so Zeng ordered his men to tie him up and hand him over to the metropolitan governor, who had him flogged to death. Landowners whose holdings bordered Zeng’s were all so afraid of his power, that they offered him their most fertile acreage. Consequently, his personal wealth grew to match that of the entire national treasury.\n\nShortly afterward, Niaoniao and Xianxian passed away, one after the other, and from morning till night he couldn’t get them out of his thoughts. Then he remembered that years earlier, he’d noticed that a daughter of the family to the east of his was absolutely beautiful, and he had long been considering the idea of buying her to become his concubine, and though he’d always been too poor to achieve his long-held desire, now he was fortunate enough to be able to do as he wished.\n\nSo he sent several able-bodied servants to strong-arm her family into accepting his money. Presently, they returned, carrying her in a wicker sedan chair, and as he watched her from a distance, he found her even more stunningly beautiful than he’d remembered her. As he looked back over his life to date, he felt that he now had everything he’d ever hoped for.\n\nAs a year went by, the court officials began whispering among themselves, cursing Zeng under their breaths. In public, however, they maintained a discreet silence; Zeng was too haughty and arrogant to pay any attention to them.\n\nThere was a scholar from Dragon’s Image Pavilion, named Bao Shangshu, who submitted a memorial to the emperor that read, “I’ve heard that this Zeng was originally a drinking, gambling rascal, a marketplace nobody. After a single conversation with Your Majesty, he was rewarded with high preferment by your wise generosity, while his father and his son were very well treated. But he’s made no personal sacrifices for his country to merit it, not even the tiniest fraction of one; instead, he indulges his urges without restraint, punishing or rewarding according to his whims. He deserves to die for his crimes, which are too many to keep track of!\n\n“The positions at court he treats as his private commodities, charging for them according to whatever someone can pay. And thus high-ranking politicians, officers, and other men have exhausted themselves in a rush to become his followers, to negotiate what it’ll cost them for him to exploit his power to advance them—like peddlers dickering with a customer—for if he doesn’t take a liking to the obsequious individuals, there’s no way they can advance any further. Maybe that’s why the principled scholars and virtuous officials who refuse to toady to him, at best find themselves assigned to minor posts, and at worst, they’re discharged altogether.\n\n“Anyone who doesn’t obey his every word and gesture meets with disaster, since no one can resist his great power; a single innocent comment, misconstrued by Zeng, can result in one’s being exiled far away, to live among uncivilized people. Courtiers are frightened of him, and hence the court has become deserted. He even wantonly confiscates the most fertile lands of the common people; and the daughters of respectable families are forced to become Zeng’s concubines. A poisonous vapor of injustice has darkened the court!\n\n“When Zeng’s servants arrive, prefecture chiefs and county magistrates must pretend to be pleased to see them; one letter from Zeng, and provincial commissioners, judges, and governors agree to pervert the law. Even his servants and his distant relatives are allowed to ride in a carriage with the imperial courier, causing a thunderous commotion as they travel.\n\n“When supplies solicited from locals are a bit slow in being prepared, men on horseback are sent to whip the people where they stand. The people are being persecuted, and local authorities are treated like servants, while in their wake, his retainers leave fields stripped bare of everything edible.\n\n“And because this fellow has risen thanks to Your Majesty’s favor, he’s completely unrepentant about his many arrogant acts. Whenever Your Majesty summons Zeng for an interview, to inquire about his work, he proceeds to slander and trump up charges against others; yet as soon as he can sneak away from court and head home, the sounds of musical entertainment rise up from his back garden. Debauchery, horse racing, and dog fighting—day and night, these are his dissolute activities; he never thinks of matters of national policy or the welfare of the people.\n\n“How can a man such as this be the prime minister! Within the court and outside it, there is outrage over his transgressions, and public sentiment has become agitated. If he isn’t brought quickly to the executioner’s block, the result will certainly be a seizure of power like those perpetrated by the usurpers Cao Cao and Wang Mang. Day and night I worry about this, and dare not sit by peacefully; thus I have risked my life to list his crimes, so Your Majesty may hear of them.\n\n“I humbly beseech you to cut off this crafty sycophant’s head, and to confiscate his ill-gotten properties, to put an end quickly to the widespread discontent of your people. If these accusations are inaccurate, may I die by the sword or be boiled in a cauldron.” And so it continued.\n\nOnce Zeng heard about the petition, his imposing manner was badly shaken, the news chilling him like a drink of ice water. Fortunately for him, the emperor was lenient and shelved the document.\n\nAfterwards, however, supervising administrators, and the nine chief ministers, delivered their own memorials to the throne, calling for Zeng’s impeachment; even those who had formerly treated him as their master, and called him their godfather, also turned against him. A decree was issued for his property to be confiscated, and for him to be banished to Yunnan. Zeng’s son was assigned to the prefecture chief in Pingyang, who’d already dispatched personnel to go and investigate him.\n\nWhen Zeng heard all this, he became frightened and alarmed, and just then several dozen palace guards arrived, bearing arms, and headed directly into his household’s inner rooms, stripping Zeng of his official vestments, then binding both Zeng and his wife. Shortly thereafter, he saw several workers carry his valuables out into the courtyard: gold, silver, coins, and paper currency, worth several million taels; several hundred _hu_ of pearls, jadeite, agate, and jade; plus several thousand canopies, curtains, screens, and beds—even his children’s baby clothes, and his wife’s shoes, were tossed downstairs into the courtyard. As Zeng looked over item after item, he felt heartbroken, and his eyes stung.\n\nThen all of a sudden, someone dragged out his beautiful concubine, who was weeping, her hair disheveled and her lovely face stricken. The sense of loss burned in Zeng’s heart, and though he was filled with outrage, he didn’t dare say a word. Soon his pavilions and storehouses were all sealed shut, and marked with signs designating their confiscation.\n\nImmediately afterward, Zeng was roughly ordered to get out. He and his wife were tied together, and then led outside. Husband and wife choked down their sobs in order to begin their journey, and though Zeng had begged for just a low-quality cart and horses so they could ride instead of walking, he was refused.\n\nWhen they had walked ten _li_, his wife’s legs became unsteady, and she felt like she was going to fall down, hence Zeng periodically gave her his hand, so he could guide her as she leaned upon him. After another ten _li_, Zeng was also exhausted. Suddenly they found themselves staring at a high mountain, whose heights pierced the sky; fretting that they couldn’t climb over it, Zeng pulled his wife close, and they looked into each other’s tear-streaked faces. But their guards glared at them, and wouldn’t allow them to rest, even for a little while. Zeng glanced back at the setting sun, realizing there was no place to stay overnight, so they had no alternative but to continue stumbling onward.\n\nOnce they were midway up the mountain, his wife’s strength gave out, and she collapsed in tears beside the road. Zeng also stopped to rest, though the guards yelled at them for relaxing. Suddenly they heard the clamor of hundreds of voices, as a band of robbers, each man carrying a sharp dagger, leapt in front of them. The guards were panicked and ran off.\n\nZeng knelt before the robbers, and said, “I’ve been convicted and sent into exile, so I have no belongings to offer you.” He implored them to pardon him.\n\nThe band of robbers, wide-eyed with anger, declared, “We’ve all been harmed by your injustices, so the only thing we need is your flattering, thieving head.”\n\nZeng testily shouted, “I may be guilty of certain crimes, but I was appointed by the emperor himself, so what can you bandits dare do to me!”\n\nThe robbers were equally angry, and swung a huge axe at Zeng’s neck. He felt his head fall, and heard it hit the ground. As his spirit was reeling in terror, two demons appeared, manacled his hands behind his back, and then marched him away.\n\nAfter they’d been walking for some time, they came to a city. In no time, they were gazing at a palace; inside, a hideous-looking king leaned on a desk, passing judgement. Zeng crept forward and pled for mercy.\n\nWhen the king had read only the first several lines of Zeng’s dossier, he began shaking with anger and exclaimed, “For the crime of deceiving the emperor and harming your country, you shall be boiled in oil!” Ten thousand ghosts gave their support, with a sound like a thunderclap. Then a giant demon seized Zeng, and brought him to the foot of the palace steps.\n\nThere he saw a seven _chi_ cauldron had already been prepared, with blazing charcoals surrounding it, and its three support legs were red hot. Zeng trembled, weeping with fear, and would have fled, but there was nowhere to go. The demon grabbed Zeng’s hair with its left hand, and his ankles with its right hand, then flung him into the cauldron.\n\nHe could feel his body bobbing up and down in the oil’s boiling waves; his flesh started burning, the excruciating pain penetrating to his very heart; as the boiling oil entered his mouth, it fried his insides. He wanted nothing so much as a speedy death, but for all his thinking about it, he couldn’t die.\n\nAfter quite some time, the demon took an enormous pitchfork, lifted Zeng out, and returned him to the great hall. The king checked his records once again and angrily decreed, “For exercising your power in order to abuse the people, you are sentenced to the mountain of knives!”\n\nThe giant demon once again dragged Zeng down the palace steps. He saw a mountain there that wasn’t very broad; but its high, steep sides were studded with sharp blades, like dense thickets of bamboo. A number of people who’d been sentenced before him had their intestines—which had spilled out from slits in their stomachs—twisted around the knives, and they were wailing in agony, the sounds tragically heart-rending.\n\nWhen the demon tried to hustle Zeng up the side, Zeng shrunk back, crying loudly. The demon then took a poison-tipped drill, and punched it into Zeng’s brain, causing him such torment that he begged for pity. The demon became infuriated, and with a powerful toss, threw Zeng high up into the air.\n\nHe felt his body plummet dizzily, until he landed on knives that plunged into his chest, causing pain that words can’t even begin to describe. As he squirmed around, over time his body responded like the others before him, the knives gradually opening broad wounds; suddenly he fell into pieces, his four limbs writhing like caterpillars. The giant demon again took him to see the king.\n\nThe monarch ordered accountants to calculate how much money Zeng had made in his lifetime from improperly selling official titles, perverting the law, and impounding others’ property. Soon a bearded man, holding the counters on which he’d made his calculations, announced, “3,210,000 taels.”\n\n“The amount that he accumulated,” replied the king, “that much shall he drink!” In a short while, the specified amount of money was heaped into a pile on the steps, till it looked like a grave mound. Piece by piece it was thrown into an iron vat, and smelted over a raging fire.\n\nSeveral demons were employed to fill ladles full of molten metal, and pour them into Zeng’s mouth, till the slag overflowed down his cheeks, burning his skin with a disgusting stench; as it went down his throat, his organs began boiling furiously. When he was alive, Zeng had worried that he’d never have enough money—but now, he worried that he’d had too much.\n\nIt took half a day to swallow all of it. The king then commanded that Zeng be taken to Ganzhou, where he would be reincarnated as a woman.\n\nAfter walking several steps, Zeng saw an iron beam that was several _chi_ in circumference, and it was supporting a wheel of fire that was unthinkably large, hundreds of _li_ across, with flames of five different colors blazing brilliantly across the sky. The demon whipped Zeng, to force him to climb onto the wheel.\n\nHe closed his eyes and jumped on, and as his feet landed, the wheel began to turn, and he felt himself begin to fall, his body feeling chilled all over. When he opened his eyes, he discovered that his body had become a baby girl’s. He saw his parents, dressed in ragged clothing, in a room with dirt walls and floor, a beggar’s gourd and staff nearby. He knew then that he was a beggar’s daughter.\n\nEach day when she was a child, she went out begging with her father, her stomach constantly growling from never having enough to eat. The clothes she wore were tattered, and the cold wind often pierced her to the bone.\n\nWhen she turned fourteen, the girl was sold to a _xiucai_ named Gu, to serve as his concubine, though the clothing and food she was given were barely adequate. In addition, Gu’s wife was quite malicious, and every day she beat the girl with a whip or a stick, often also applying a red-hot branding iron to the concubine’s breasts. Fortunately, Gu loved her quite dearly, and was able to offer her a bit of consolation.\n\nThe neighbor to the east of Gu was a wicked young man, who suddenly one night climbed over the wall, and was about to rape the concubine. Zeng thought over his own great wickedness of the past, and what the demons had already done to him, and now it was happening all over again. Hence the concubine cried out in a loud voice. Gu and his wife both sprang up, and the wicked young man ran off.\n\nShortly afterward, when Gu was sleeping with the concubine in her room, she lay on her pillow chattering on and on, complaining that great injustices had been done to her. Suddenly there was a noise at the door to the room, as two knife-wielding thieves rushed in, cut off Gu’s head, then stuffed the couple’s clothing and belongings into a bag. The concubine hid under the quilt, and didn’t dare make a sound.\n\nOnce the thieves had gone, she cried for help, and rushed to the room of Gu’s wife. The wife was horrified, and went back with the girl to examine Gu’s body. Suspecting that the concubine, in collusion with some lover, had killed Gu, the wife took the matter to the prefectural governor. The governor conducted a severe investigation, which concluded with cruel torture that led the concubine to plead guilty, and so according to the law, she was sentenced to die by dismemberment.\n\nAs she was bound and taken to the place of execution, her chest filling with anger at the wrongs done to her, she stopped and stamped her feet, crying out that even the underworld and its eighteen levels weren’t this unrelentingly dark.\n\nZeng was crying piteously, when he heard his traveling companions asking, “Are you having a bad dream?” Suddenly he awakened, and saw that the old monk was still sitting cross-legged on his cushion. Zeng’s associates complained, “Our stomachs have been empty all day—how could you sleep so long?” Wearing a dismal expression, Zeng then got up.\n\nWith a tiny laugh, the monk asked him, “Did you become prime minister as predicted?” Zeng was astonished, and after bowing respectfully, he begged the monk to explain more to him. “If you cultivate virtue and act with benevolence,” replied the monk, “then even in a fiery pit, the Buddha can save you. As a mountain monk, that’s all I know.”\n\nZeng had been cocky when he arrived, but he felt quite chastened as he left. His ambition to become a high official faded away following his experience. He went into the mountains, and no one knows what became of him.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Good fortune comes to those who are kind, and calamity to the wicked, for such is the way of heaven. While Zeng was delighted to hear that he would become prime minister, his happiness had nothing to do with serving his country selflessly. In his heart, he desired palaces, houses, wives and concubines, wanting to have it all. But such a dream is absurd, and such desires are unrealistic. When someone acts badly in a dream, the gods accordingly will subject that person to punishment. When the yellow millet is nearly finished cooking, and an individual hasn’t realized the brevity of life, a dream like this will come—so it’s only right that this one should serve as a sequel to the dream a certain fellow had when he was traveling to Handan.”",

        "body": "Wei Zhongtang, from Shanxi, who was a _zhusheng_ at the time, became tired of the constant interruptions in his life, and decided to move his study to a Buddhist temple. But he was so tormented by the many bedbugs, mosquitoes, and fleas in his room, that he couldn’t get to sleep all night long.\n\nAfter having a meal, he laid down on his bed to take a nap. Suddenly a tiny warrior appeared, his head covered with pheasant tail feathers, his body about two _cun_ tall; he was riding a horse as big as a grasshopper, and had a falcon the size of a fly sitting on his green falconer’s armlet; when he entered from the outside, he came galloping into the room at full speed. As Wei was staring at him, another man came in, dressed like the first, with tiny bow and arrows strapped to his waist, leading a hunting dog that looked like an enormous ant.\n\nThen after a few moments, both walking and riding, several hundred people came in, one after another, with falcons on hundreds of arms, and hundreds of dogs as well. Whenever a mosquito or a fly flew by, the falcons were released to pursue, strike, and kill it. The hunting dogs used the wall to climb up on the bed, flushing out and biting lice and fleas, checking all the crevices where they might be hiding, invariably sniffing them out. With great dispatch, they wiped out virtually all of the vermin. Wei watched them while pretending to be asleep. The falcons then landed on his body, while the dogs also hurried there.\n\nSubsequently, a man in yellow clothing, wearing a flat-topped cap like an emperor, climbed up with the others onto the bed, where they secured a team of horses to a crack between strips in one of the bamboo mats. All of his followers dismounted, and displayed to him the things that they had captured, then gathered behind him, murmuring something that Wei couldn’t understand.\n\nSoon, the emperor climbed into a tiny man-drawn carriage, his bodyguards hurrying to accompany him on saddled horses; as thousands of hooves thundered off, their vast numbers sounding like the sifting of dried beans, a fog formed and covered them, and in a moment, they’d all vanished.\n\nAs Wei took this in with his eyes, he was so startled that he couldn’t figure out what was going on. He put on his shoes and peeked outside, but there were neither footprints nor sounds of the tiny people. He turned around and scanned his study, but didn’t see a trace anywhere; except, that is, on a brick in the wall, where a skinny dog had been left behind.\n\nWei quickly caught and tamed it. He placed it in a small box on his inkstone, and played with the dog over and over. Its fur was very fine, and there was a tiny collar around its neck. He tried to feed it rice and other grains, but it simply sniffed at the food, then turned away and left. It jumped up to climb onto his bed and paw through his clothing, so it could bite and kill any lice there. Then it came back to him and lay down.\n\nThe next morning, Wei was worried that it might already be gone; but when he looked for it, he found the dog reclining there, like before. Whenever Wei laid down on the bed, it would climb up onto the mat on his bed, and wherever it found any bugs, it would eat them; hence mosquitoes and flies didn’t dare land there any longer. Wei loved the dog, and valued it more than a round piece of precious jade.\n\nOne day, while he was napping in the daytime, the dog laid down next to him. When Wei turned over on his side, he unwittingly laid on it; feeling that something was there, and fearing that it might be the dog, he rushed to get up and check on it, but found it already dead, flattened like a paper cut-out.\n\nBut after that, of course, there were never again any insects on Wei’s wall.",

        "title": "The Chess Ghost",
        "body": "When the military governor in Yangzhou, a man named Liang, resigned his post, he retired to live in the countryside, where he could play chess and enjoy his wine each day, while wandering through the forests and hills. Around the time of the Double Ninth Festival, he climbed up into the hills with a friend to play some chess.\n\nSuddenly a man appeared, wandering beside their chessboard, watching them play without any intention of leaving. Liang noticed that the man appeared needy, his clothing hanging on him in ragged tatters. Even so, his demeanor was gentle and refined, and he had the scholarly air of a man of letters.\n\nLiang greeted him courteously, and then he sat down. The man seemed particularly modest. Liang pointed to the chessboard and said, “Sir, you must be good at this, so why not play it with my guest?” The scholar humbly declined initially, but then began to play a game.\n\nWhen it was over, he had lost, and he looked irritated, since he’d been so enthusiastic to play. He played another game, and again he lost, feeling even more embarrassed and angry. Liang poured him some wine, but he didn’t drink any, since he could think of nothing but his chess game with Liang’s friend. They played from morning until the sun began slanting towards the west, and the man wouldn’t even take time out to urinate.\n\nThen, because of a particular positioning of pieces in a game, the two began debating back and forth, till suddenly the scholar left his seat as though terrified by something, exhibiting an expression of pure misery. Shortly thereafter, he came to where Liang was seated, began pressing his forehead to the ground until it became bloodied, and begged to be saved.\n\nStartled and puzzled, Liang stood and helped the man up, saying, “We were just playing a game—why take it so seriously?”\n\n“I beg you to instruct your groom not to tie me up by the neck,” the scholar replied.\n\nLiang found this equally strange, and asked, “What groom do you mean?”\n\n“Ma Cheng,” he replied. Earlier, Ma Cheng had been working in Liang’s stable, but he was also employed as a servant in the underworld, sometimes leaving for more than ten days at a time, bearing official authorization for him to serve as a ghost-catcher.\n\nLiang thought the scholar’s words so strange, that he sent someone to go and look at Ma Cheng, and found that he’d already been lying stiff and motionless for two days. Liang then shouted at Ma that he wouldn’t stand for his impertinence to the scholar. Suddenly, the scholar fell to the ground and disappeared. Liang, startled, stood motionless for quite a while, before realizing that the man had been a ghost.\n\nThe following day, Ma Cheng awakened, so Liang asked him to describe what had happened. Ma explained, “The scholar, a real chess addict, who was from around Xiangjiang’s Dongting Lake, played away all his belongings. His father was worried about his future, so he shut him away in his study. But the son climbed over the wall and got out, furtively leading others someplace where they could play chess.\n\n“When his father heard about this, he berated his son, but in the long run he couldn’t make him stop. Full of indignant anger, the father died. Yama, the Hell King, found the son’s actions so immoral, that he shortened the young man’s lifespan, and has been punishing him in the underworld for the last seven years.\n\n“To commemorate the establishment of a tower in the palace of the god of Mt. Tai, the god sent orders to subordinates to recruit men of letters to compose essays for the tower on stone tablets. Subsequently, the Hell King let the chess-playing scholar out of the underworld, and required him to take on this task in order to redeem his misspent life.\n\n“Unexpectedly, however, the scholar delayed arriving, traveling only halfway there, and was well past the established deadline. The god of the mountain then sent an official straightaway to ask the Hell King about the misunderstanding. The king became angry, and sent me to find him. But then I followed the order you gave, and didn’t dare tie him up by the neck.”\n\nLiang asked, “Now what will become of him?”\n\n“As was the case before he was remanded to his jailer,” replied Ma, “he now has no chance to redeem his life, or to be reborn into the world again.”\n\nLiang sighed, and exclaimed, “Addictions will lead us astray, as was the case for this man!”\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Playing chess made him forget that he would eventually die; then when he died, playing chess made him forget that he could be reborn. Doesn’t this mean that he desired his addiction more than his life? Unfortunately, with an addiction like this, one doesn’t become a truly excellent chess player, and one also forfeits the chance of returning to life, remaining in the underworld as a chess ghost. What a pity!”",

        "body": "Scholar Feng of Guangping lived in the time of Emperor Zhengde’s reign. Feng was frivolous when he was young, and enjoyed drinking to excess. One dawn, he went out for a walk and met a young woman, dressed in a short red cape, her happy, serene face quite lovely. She was following a small servant boy, rushing quickly through the dew, so her shoes and stockings were thoroughly soaked with it. In his heart, Feng secretly fell in love with her.\n\nBy dusk he was drunk, so he headed home, and on the way he passed an old temple, long abandoned and untended, and when the beautiful young woman he’d seen earlier emerged from it, he hastened towards her. When she noticed him suddenly approaching, she turned around and went back inside. Feng wondered to himself: What’s a beauty like that doing in this rundown temple? He tied his donkey to the gate, and went inside to investigate the odd coincidence.\n\nAs he entered, he found that chunks of the walls had collapsed, and there was a thin, carpet-like growth of grass on the steps. As Feng hesitated briefly, a white-haired old man came out, his clothes and cap both clean and tidy, and asked him, “What’ve you come here for, sir?”\n\n“I happened to be passing by this ancient temple, and I wanted to take a closer look at it,” Feng replied. “Why have _you_ come here, sir?”\n\nThe old man explained, “I have no permanent home, so I’m temporarily staying here with my family. Since you’re here, you can try some of our wild mountain tea and pretend that it’s some wine.” And so he respectfully invited Feng inside.\n\nFeng saw that behind the temple there was a courtyard, with a shining stone walkway that wasn’t obscured by the vegetation surrounding it. When they entered the old man’s room, Feng noticed a room-dividing curtain, and a curtained bed; the room was sprayed with a fragrant mist. They sat down and the old man modestly introduced himself, saying, “My name is Xin.”\n\nFeng used the excuse of being drunk, and quickly blurted, “I hear that you have an unmarried daughter, and I haven’t yet found a suitable mate. I’m not much to offer, but I hope I might be able to marry her.”\n\nXin laughed, and replied, “Perhaps I should consult with my wife.”\n\nFeng immediately asked for a brush, and composed a poem that read, “With a thousand taels I bought a jade pestle, / My hands eager to put it to use. / If it is your wish, Yunying, / I could use the pestle myself to grind your grandma’s medicine.” The old man laughed heartily at this.\n\nAfter a bit, a maidservant entered, and spoke some words privately to Xin. The old man then stood up, prevailing upon his guest to wait patiently, and drawing the room’s curtain, walked inside. Concealed thus, Xin spoke several words while inside, and then came back. Feng figured that the old man had some good news to announce; but Xin then sat down, and resumed his chatting and laughing, with no further discussion of Feng’s proposal.\n\nWhen Feng could stand it no longer, he had to find out why, so he exclaimed, “You haven’t discussed my offer, so I hope you’ll explain why to me, and allow any doubts to be dismissed.”\n\n“You are a superb scholar, and I’ve admired you for a long time now,” Xin answered him. “However, there’s a private concern that I dare not mention to you.” Feng insistently begged him to explain. “I have nineteen daughters, and twelve are married,” said Xin. “My wife takes care of all wedding agreements, so I can’t make the decision.”\n\nFeng told him, “I only want to marry the one who was walking with her little servant boy, and whose feet became wet with dew.” Xin wouldn’t respond, and thus they just sat facing each other in silence.\n\nFrom the other side of the room’s curtain, they heard the sound of intimate words being whispered, so Feng took advantage of his drunken state to pull aside the curtain and declare, “Even if I can’t obtain this beauty, I should at least have a look at your face, and then all my regrets will vanish.”\n\nWhen they heard the sound of curtain hooks being moved, the people on the other side of the curtain stood up with shocked expressions, and the young woman in red shook out her sleeves, bowed her head, and stood gracefully erect as she gently touched her robe’s belt. The people inside watched Feng approach, and rushed around the room in alarm.\n\nInfuriated, Xin ordered several servants to grab Feng, and take him outside. There the effects of the wine overwhelmed him, and he collapsed into some bushes and weeds. The servants chucked tiles and stones at him, but fortunately for Feng, none of them hit him.\n\nAfter laying there a while, he began to stir, hearing the donkey chewing grass by the roadside, so he got up and straddled the beast, which staggered forward under his half-conscious control. In the evening darkness, Feng became disoriented, and mistakenly entered a valley ravine, where wolves prowled and owls hooted, making his hair stand on end as he trembled with fear. He looked around uncertainly, and truly had no idea where he was.\n\nAs he gazed into the distance at a dark forest, lights appeared and disappeared, leading him to suspect that there must be a village there, so he hurried on to find a place there to stay. Soon he looked up and saw a tall gateway, so he used a whip to bang on the gate.\n\nFrom inside, someone asked him, “Where are you from, sir, that you arrive like this in the middle of the night?” Feng announced that he’d lost his way, and hence he was asked to “Wait while the master is informed.” Feng stopped, dismounted, and stretched his neck while he was waiting. Suddenly he heard the outer door being unlocked, and a strong-looking servant came out to take care of the donkey for him.\n\nFeng went inside and found himself in a magnificently beautiful room, where lights had been set up at the head of the hallway. He sat down for a short while. A lady came out, and asked him his surname. Feng then told her who he was.\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour, several servants helped an old woman in, and announced, “Her ladyship has arrived.” Feng stood up, preparing to prostrate himself to pay his respects to her.\n\nThe elderly lady stopped him, then sat down and inquired, “You’re not Feng Yunzi’s grandson, are you?”\n\n“That’s correct, I am,” he replied.\n\n“I believe you must be my nephew’s son,” she told him. “My old body has worn out, and my years have come to an end, so I seldom make contact among the relatives.”\n\n“I lost my father when I was a boy,” Feng said, “and as for the relatives on my grandfather’s side, I barely know one in ten. I’ve never paid you a visit, but now I’m begging you for your advice.”\n\nThe old lady replied, “You know me, actually.” Feng didn’t dare ask any more questions, so he sat down and tried to focus his concentration. “Grandnephew,” the old lady asked, “what brings you here so late at night?” Feng had always regarded himself as a courageous man, so he forthrightly recounted the details, one by one, of what had happened at the temple.\n\nWith a laugh, the old lady said, “This is an excellent business. The fact is, you’re well known, grandnephew, and it would be one thing if you hadn’t disgraced yourself with your prospective in-laws; but how can that wild fox spirit behave so high-and-mightily? Don’t worry, I can help make things work out for you.” Feng thanked her emphatically. The old lady paused, and then remarked to those beside her, “I don’t know anything about the Xin family’s daughters, and whether they’re such good girls.”\n\nOne of her servants volunteered, “Master Xin has nineteen daughters, and they all have elegant manners; but does the gentleman know which one he wants to marry?”\n\n“The one about fifteen years old,” replied Feng.\n\nThe servant declared, “That would be the fourteenth daughter. In March, she accompanied her mother to your ladyship’s birthday celebration, don’t you remember?”\n\nThe old lady laughed and said, “Isn’t she the one with the engravings of lotus petals on the bottom of her shoes, who covered her face with gauze while walking?”\n\n“She is,” replied the servant.\n\n“This serving girl has great instincts for coming up with creative ideas, and has some unique abilities,” the old lady told Feng, “while your Xin daughter is an elegant young woman indeed. You haven’t made the wrong choice, grandnephew.” She then approached the maidservant, and instructed her, “Send a small fox servant to call for her to come here.” The maidservant promised she would do so, and then left.\n\nA short time later, someone came in and reported, “We just got the call that fourteenth daughter Xin has arrived.” Soon they saw a young woman in red clothing, and when she spotted the old lady, she began to prostrate herself in obeisance.\n\nThe old lady tugged at her to stop, declaring, “Later, you’ll become my grandnephew’s wife, so you don’t have to stand on ceremony, like some kind of servant.” The young woman got up, revealing her slim beauty as she stood, her red sleeves hanging at her sides.\n\nThe old lady tidied the hair over the girl’s temples, and played with her earrings as she asked, “What do you spend your time doing, as fourteenth daughter, in your maiden room?”\n\nThe young woman lowered her head in response, as she replied, “Nothing special, just my embroidery.” She turned her head to look at Feng, then bashfully turned back, flustered.\n\n“This is my grandnephew,” the old lady said. “He believes his happiness depends upon making a good marriage with you—so why did you make him lose his way, and wander through a deep valley in the dark?” The girl bowed her head in acquiescence, without a word. “I summoned you here for only one thing,” the old lady revealed, “and I’ll act as your go-between.” The girl remained silent and still.\n\nThe old lady ordered someone to prepare a wedding bed for them, to unite them right away. The young woman blushed, and said, “I have to go back and report this to my parents.”\n\nThe old lady countered, “I’m your matchmaker, so what’s the problem?”\n\n“My parents wouldn’t dare to disobey your ladyship,” replied the girl, “but I won’t accept such a hasty marriage, even if it means sacrificing my life!”\n\nThe old lady laughed and said, “Dear, you’re a really determined girl, truly qualified to be my grandnephew’s wife!” Then she took a garland of golden flowers from the girl’s head, and handed it to Feng, who accepted it. The old lady directed her to return home, and check the calendar to select an auspicious date for the wedding. Then she assigned a servant to accompany the young woman as she left. When she heard a rooster crowing in the distance, she sent someone to get the donkey and accompany Feng on his way out.\n\nOnce Feng had ridden several paces out of the village, he suddenly looked back, but the village and the houses were gone; instead, he saw nothing but a dense black pine forest, and bricks, made of grass and mud, covering a grave mound. For a few moments, he tried to decide what to do, and then he became aware that he was at the grave of Xue Shangshu. Xue was the younger brother of Feng’s grandfather, and for that reason the “lady” had called him her grandnephew. He realized that he’d encountered Xue’s ghost, but he also realized that he didn’t know who fourteenth daughter Xin really was.\n\nHe heaved a sigh, and went home, where he searched the calendar and waited, but he was afraid that the ghost might not keep its promise. Then he returned to the bleak and desolate temple, but saw no one in the isolated place. He asked around and was told that people had often seen foxes there. He thought to himself: As long as I can marry that beauty, I’ll be happy, even if she’s a fox.\n\nThe next day, he cleaned up inside his home and along the road, and set out servants in shifts to watch off in the distance, but by midnight, his house was still quiet. Feng was about to give up hope.\n\nAn instant later, there was an uproar outside the gate. Feng couldn’t wait until he slipped on his shoes to rush out and take a look, and there he saw the embroidered curtains in a bridal sedan chair, that had come to a stop in the courtyard, and a pair of maidservants assisted the woman inside it into her new home. There wasn’t much to her trousseau, and it only took two long-bearded servants to carry in a clay bank the size of a large ceramic jar, to lift it down from their shoulders, and to place it in a corner of the hall.\n\nFeng joyfully received the beauty, and actually didn’t think it anything strange. He asked her, “What made your family listen so willingly to a ghost?”\n\n“Xue Shangshu is now the patrol official for five cities,” said the young woman, “and for several hundred _li_ all of the ghosts and foxes have been retained as escorts, so he seldom returns to his grave without one’s having met him by chance.” Feng wasn’t about to forget the matchmaker’s efforts, so the next day, he went to make sacrifices at Xue’s grave.\n\nWhen he returned home, he saw two servants carrying a decorative silk plant, made in a shell pattern, that they set on a stool before leaving. Feng told the girl about this, and when she saw it, she said, “This is from her ladyship.”\n\nIn town there was an official named Chu, who worked for the Office of Transmission, and who, when younger, had studied together with Feng, so they were pretty close to each other. When he heard that Feng had married a fox wife, he sent them a feast as a present, and visited Feng right away, to drink some wine with his friend.\n\nSeveral days later, he sent a letter inviting Feng over for drinks. When his wife heard about it, she told Feng, “Last time, when he came here, I peered out from the wall of my den, at this man with simian eyes and an aquiline nose—I don’t think you should be close with him any longer. You shouldn’t go.” Feng agreed he wouldn’t go.\n\nThe next day, Chu showed up at their gate, asking why Feng hadn’t come when he was invited, and also inviting Feng to read his new essays. Feng mocked and criticized Chu about his writing, till Chu, horribly embarrassed and unhappy, finally left. Feng went back inside, laughing as he described what had happened.\n\nHis worried wife declared, “Chu is such a wicked, cruel man—how could you have been friendly with him! If you don’t listen to what I’m telling you, you’ll suffer for it later!” Feng laughed again, and thanked her for her concern. Later on, Chu encouraged Feng to exchange flattering chat and laughter with him, seizing the opportunity to smooth out things between them.\n\nOnce the results of the public examination were revealed, Chu discovered he had finished number one, and Feng number two. Chu was pleased to send someone to deliver an invitation for Feng to come over for drinks. Feng declined, but after he was repeatedly importuned, he went.\n\nUpon arriving, he could tell that it must be Chu’s birthday, for guests and attendants filled the hall, and a grand banquet had been laid out. Chu came out with the examination papers to show Feng. His friends and relatives crowded together, to show their appreciation for his essays.\n\nThey drank several rounds of wine; music resounded through the hall, and drums pounded raucously, putting both guests and host in a jubilant mood. Chu suddenly told Feng, “The proverb says, ‘In the examination room, trust your destiny, not your essays.’ I now know these words to be false. The reason that I received a higher ranking than you is that one transitional portion of my essay was a little better than yours.” When Chu finished speaking, everyone there praised him.\n\nFeng was so drunk that he couldn’t contain himself, and laughing loudly, said, “How can you still believe that you beat me on the merit of your essay!” As Feng sat down, Chu paled noticeably. He felt embarrassed and angry, scorned by Feng’s response. The guests gradually began to leave, so Feng also took the opportunity to slip out.\n\nAs he sobered up, he began to regret his behavior, so he told his wife about it. She unhappily replied, “Thanks to your rudeness and lack of foresight, now you’ve insulted him! Imposing your cheap behavior on a gentleman will tarnish your reputation; but imposing it on that wicked man puts us in danger of being killed. Your destruction’s not far off! I can’t bear to see you wandering about destitute, so I beg you therefore to let me take my leave of you here.”\n\nFeng was frightened into tears by her words, and told her how sorry he was. “If you want me to stay,” she told him, “then you must make this pact: From now on, you will shut your doors, and cut off contact with your friends, and also stop your unrestrained drinking.” Feng accepted her conditions sincerely.\n\nFourteenth daughter Xin was a hardworking and thrifty person, who spent her days spinning and weaving. Whenever it was time for her to visit her parents, she never stayed away overnight. And sometimes she produced golden silk to make a living for her husband and herself. Each day’s profits were tossed into the ceramic coin bank. The gate and doors were always kept shut, and if anyone came to pay them a visit, they always had the servants decline and turn them away.\n\nOne day, a letter directly from Chu arrived, and fourteenth daughter burned it before Feng could open it. The next day, Feng left to attend a funeral, where he ran into Chu, and Chu grabbed his arm, delivering his embittered invitation. Feng consequently declined again.\n\nChu sent a horse groom to take care of Feng’s horse, and put his arm around Feng, ensuring that they left for Chu’s house together. When they arrived, Chu immediately ordered the servants to prepare sumptuous food and drink for them. Then Feng declined as he had previously, and withdrew. Chu then contrived for the women of his household to play the zheng for them.\n\nFeng was by nature uninhibited, so his being shut up in the courtyard of his home had him feeling rather bored and deprived; suddenly he felt the need to carouse, determining to become unrestrained once again, and not to give his wife’s warning a second thought. Consequently, he was soon dead drunk, decadently collapsed in the middle of the banquet.\n\nChu’s wife, named Ruan, was ferociously jealous, so Chu’s maidservants and concubines didn’t dare make themselves appear attractive. A day earlier, when a maidservant had entered Chu’s study, she was caught by Ruan, who grabbed her and beat her over the head wih a cane, until her brains spilled out, killing her.\n\nChu took Feng’s mocking and standoffishness to be insults, so he often thought about how to get revenge on him, finally deciding to get him drunk, and then falsely to accuse him of murder. He took advantage of Feng’s drinking himself to sleep, and had someone carry him to the bed where the maidservant’s corpse had been placed, then shut the door and left.\n\nAs Feng awoke with a hangover at the fifth watch, he felt himself laying on the bed; he got up to find out where the pillow was, felt something greasy, got tangled up in the bedclothes, and stumbled; when he felt around again, he could tell it was a person: he figured Chu must have sent a boy to sleep with him. But when he prodded it, there was no movement from the stiffened body.\n\nTerrified, he ran out the door, crying that there was something strange inside. The menial servants all roused up and brought lights, and when they saw the corpse, they grabbed Feng with an angry uproar. Chu came out to examine Feng, then falsely accused him of raping and killing a maidservant, so they seized him and delivered him to the authorities in Guangping.\n\nThe following day, fourteenth daughter recognized what had happened, and tearfully cried, “Early on, I knew a day like this would come!” Accordingly, she began taking money for Feng to Guangping each day.\n\nFeng was brought before the governor of the prefecture, who without justification approved the order to have Feng whipped from morning till night, till his flesh peeled off. Fourteenth daughter came, and asked to visit Feng. When Feng saw her, he felt so guilty that it was like he couldn’t breathe, and he found himself unable to speak.\n\nFourteenth daughter knew how deep a pit he was in, so she persuaded him to confess to the false accusation in order to avoid further torture under the law. Feng wept as he listened to her advice. As she came and went, no one else saw her, even if they were only a _chi_ away from her.\n\nShe returned home, and following consultation and sighs, she hastily dispatched a maidservant on business. After waiting at home alone for several days, she hired a marriage broker to purchase Feng a wife from a respectable family, a girl named Lu’er, about fifteen years old, widely known to be quite lovely; her daily life with fourteenth daughter subsequently became quite harmonious, and fourteenth daughter felt a special fondness for her, treating Lu’er as an equal to herself, rather than as a concubine.\n\nFeng falsely confessed that he had killed the maidservant, and was sentenced to be hanged. A servant took this message back home, and everyone was so grieved that they couldn’t make a sound. When fourteenth daughter heard the news, she remained calm, without exhibiting any sadness.\n\nLater, when the day for the annual executions was approaching, she began anxiously engaging in restless worry, every day and night, constantly pacing back and forth. Each lonely day, she was so sorrowful that she couldn’t sleep and eat. One day, after noon, a fox maidservant suddenly arrived. Fourteenth daughter immediately got up and conducted her to where they could talk in private. When she went outside again, there was a smile on her face, and she returned to dealing with business as usual.\n\nThe next day, when a servant arrived at the prison, Feng sent word for fourteenth daughter to come and bid her final farewell to him. The servant delivered his instructions. Fourteenth daughter responded casually, not at all saddened, seeming oddly calm. Family members remarked between themselves about her dispassionate endurance.\n\nSuddenly the roadway began to rumble with news: the official Chu was dismissed from his position in the Office of Transmission; the Pingyang prefecture had accepted a special command to investigate Feng’s case. When the servants heard this, they joyfully ran to tell their mistress. Fourteenth daughter was also overjoyed, so she went to the government office in Guangping—where Feng had already been released from prison—to greet him with tears and joy.\n\nAt the same time, Chu had been arrested and brought in, and everything had been cleared up during the ensuing investigation. Feng was released to return home right away. When he saw his wife in the hall there, his tears flowed freely, and fourteenth daughter, facing him with her own sorrow and pain, felt her sadness come to an end, and rejoiced.\n\nHowever, in the end, Feng didn’t understand why his case had received another hearing. Fourteenth daughter laughed, pointed at her maidservant, and said, “Here’s your deliverer.” Feng, stunned, asked her to explain.\n\nOriginally, fourteenth sister had sent the maidservant to the imperial palace to exclaim Feng’s innocence. When the maidservant arrived, there were spirits on guard in the palace, forcing her back in front of the stream flowing through the imperial garden, and so for several months, she was unable to enter there.\n\nThe maidservant was afraid this would interfere with her mission, so she was wishing she could go home to put together another plan, when suddenly she heard that the emperor was just about to make a “personal visit” to Datong—and the maidservant went there ahead of his arrival, to pretend to be a prostitute who’d wandered there. When the emperor arrived at the brothel in Datong, he began freely and tenderly granting favors. He suspected that the maidservant wasn’t really an itinerant prostitute, and just about then, she began to weep.\n\n“What wrong has been done to you?” asked the emperor.\n\nShe replied, “I’ve come from Guangping, and I’m the daughter of Feng, a successful candidate in the local civil service examination. My father has been wrongly imprisoned and is on the verge of dying, so I sold myself into this brothel.”\n\nThe emperor grieved for their suffering, and bestowed a hundred taels on her. As he was about to go, he made detailed inquiries into the whole matter from beginning to end, and then took brush and paper, so he could make a record of the man’s name; in addition, he told the maidservant that he wanted to share his wealth and rank with her. She replied, “If only my father and I can be reunited, I wouldn’t ask for anything more.” The emperor nodded and then left. The maidservant took this as a sign that he would help Feng.\n\nFeng anxiously thanked her for all that she’d done, and their tears glistened like precious stones.\n\nFeng hadn’t been home for long when fourteenth daughter suddenly told him, “I haven’t been terribly fortunate in my relationship with you, have I? When you were arrested, I devoted myself to planning how to save you, without anyone else stepping in to help out. I suffered bitterly, and I couldn’t really let you know how I felt. Now I see that this mortal world is filled with pain. I’ve already helped you save up for a fine spouse, so now we can go our separate ways.” Upon hearing this, Feng tearfully prostrated himself, and wouldn’t get up. Fourteenth daughter then stopped talking to him.\n\nThat evening, she sent Lu’er to sleep with Feng, but he refused to let her into his bed. In the morning, he looked at fourteenth sister, and found that she had lost much of her attractive appearance; a month later, she’d begun to age noticeably; in six months, she turned as dark-skinned as a rural peasant woman. However, Feng remained respectful to her, and wouldn’t exchange her for a new wife.\n\nFourteenth daughter suddenly began talking to him again, and told him, “You have a beautiful companion in Lu’er, so why bother to keep me, such an old hag?” Feng just moaned as he had previously.\n\nWhen another month had passed, fourteenth daughter fell violently ill, stopped eating and drinking, and lay in one of the inner rooms, thin and weak. Feng diligently waited on her with medicinal broth, as though he was caring for his own parents. A shaman proved unable to help her, and she finally died quite suddenly.\n\nFeng was so heartbroken and distraught that he wanted to end it all. The maidservant immediately gave him some of the money she’d received from the emperor, so he could feed the monks who would pray for fourteenth daughter, and also so he could pay to bury her. After several days, the maidservant also departed, and so he took Lu’er as his wife.\n\nA year went by, and they had a son. However, for successive years the harvests had not been good, so his family’s fortunes declined even further. Feng and Lu’er had no ideas about what to do, so the couple just became even more downhearted. Suddenly they remembered the ceramic coin bank in the corner of the hall, into which they’d often seen fourteenth daughter toss money, but they didn’t know if it was still there or not.\n\nAs they drew close, they saw that the crock had been buried under jars of salt and beans. One by one, they removed the salt and bean jars, setting them aside, then probed the contents of the bank with chopsticks, discovering that it was so full that they couldn’t poke into it; they jabbed at it until it cracked apart, and money spilled out. Thus they suddenly became quite well off.\n\nLater on, when some of their servants were near the western summit of Mt. Hua, they ran across fourteenth daughter, riding on a dark mule, with the maidservant straddling the mule behind her, and she asked, “Did everything turn out well for Master Feng?” She added, “Send my regards to your master—I’ve already recorded myself in the register of immortals.” When her words were finished, she disappeared.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “It’s a pitiful fact that frivolous words often come from intellectuals. I once tried to speak out, saying something that risked my being criticized by others; however, I never gave up being diligent and self-reflective just in order to take part in an intellectual circle, and hence I avoided facing the same kind of misfortune as Feng.\n\n“In the case of scholar Feng, a word may seem like a small thing, but he would have been killed because of of it, if not for the deeds of his celestial wife—could he have been freed so easily from prison to return to life in the world again, if not for her intervention? That’s what we need to fear!”",

        "body": "There was a certain White Lotus Society master—I forget his name—from Shanxi, who was probably a follower of Xu Hongru. His magical abilities quite astounded people, and many of his admirers asked him to become their master.\n\nThis certain master was about to go somewhere one day, and in the main hall of his house he had placed a basin, which was then covered; he assigned one of his disciples to watch over it carefully, to protect its contents from being exposed to sight. After the master left, the disciple opened the basin, saw that it contained clear, fresh water, and observed that floating on the water was a boat made from woven grass, equipped with a mast and everything.\n\nHe thought it curious, and then he poked at it with his finger, immediately causing the boat to tip over; then he anxiously returned it to its original position, and covered it up as before. In an instant, his master rushed in and cried, “Why have you disobeyed my orders?” The disciple stood up and claimed he hadn’t done so. “The boat capsized on the sea just now,” the master declared, “so why are you trying to deceive me?”\n\nThen one night, the master lit an enormous candle at the head of the hall, and ordered the disciple to guard it scrupulously, to ensure that the wind wouldn’t blow it out. By the second watch, the master still hadn’t returned. Worn out from his vigil, the disciple gave up and lay down on a bed for a short nap; when he finally woke up, the candle had already been blown out, so he frantically got up and relit it.\n\nJust then, the master entered, and reproached him again. “Indeed, I never fell asleep,” the disciple replied, “so how could the candle possibly have been blown out?” The master angrily demanded, “Just now, I had to travel over ten _li_ in the dark, so how dare you make that claim?” The disciple was quite abashed. There were too many similarly amazing demonstrations to list them all individually.\n\nLater on, a disciple began communicating with the master’s favorite concubine. The master sensed this, but didn’t saying anything about it to them. The master sent the disciple to feed some pigs one day; when he entered the pigsty, he was immediately transformed into a pig. The master quickly called for some men to butcher him and then to sell his pork flesh. None of the men knew it was the disciple.\n\nBecause his son didn’t come home, the disciple’s father made inquiries about him, and was told that he hadn’t been around for some time. The disciple’s family visited all kinds of places, but could turn up no news about him. There was another master who secretly knew what had happened, so he told the disciple’s father all about it.\n\nThe father then informed the county magistrate. The magistrate was afraid that the master would escape, so he didn’t attempt to capture and punish him; he prevailed upon a high official, begged him for a thousand men, and surrounded the master’s residence, where they closed in and arrested his family members, including his wife and sons. They shut them into a wooden prison cart, to be escorted to the capital.\n\nOn the way, the group passed through Taihang Mountain, where from inside the mountain, a giant emerged, as tall as a tree, with eyes like large drinking vessels, a mouth like a tub, and teeth about a _chi_ long. The soldiers accompanying the prisoner were stunned, and didn’t dare go any further. The master told them, “My wife can drive this demon back.”\n\nIn response to his words, they untied his wife. Carrying a halberd, she went forward. The giant grew angry, sucked her into his mouth, and swallowed her. The soldiers became even more terrified.\n\nThe master instructed them, “It’s already killed my wife, so now you need my son to kill it.” Then they let his son out, and he was also swallowed down in the same fashion. The soldiers all looked on helplessly, not knowing what to do.\n\nThe master, weeping in anger, cried, “It already killed my wife, and now that it’s also killed my son, my love for them demands revenge! But I can’t do anything like this.” The soldiers consequently let him out of the prison cart, gave the master a blade, and sent him to challenge the creature.\n\nThe haughty giant then attacked him. They grappled with each other briefly, till the giant snatched him up, stuffed the master in his mouth, stretched his neck to swallow him down, and then finally left the valley.",

        "body": "Wei Yunwang was a resident of Pengquan, in Yidu county, where his family had been rich and influential for generations. After his family’s fortunes began to fail, they weren’t able to pay for him to attend school. Once he turned twenty, then, he went to work for his father-inlaw, selling wine.\n\nOne night, Wei was by himself, laying down upstairs in his father-in-law’s wine shop, when he suddenly heard the sound of someone walking around downstairs. This startled Wei, so he sat up, frightened by what he’d heard. The sound gradually came closer, as though someone was searching for the stairs and then climbing up them, step by step, the volume steadily increasing.\n\nBefore long, a pair of maidservants appeared, carrying lanterns, and stopped when they arrived at Wei’s bed. After them, a young scholar, leading a young lady, drew near the bed with a smile. Wei was quite stunned by the strangeness of it all. It seemed clear to him that they were foxes, which scared him so much that his hair stood on end, and he bowed his head since he didn’t dare look at them.\n\nThe scholar laughed and said, “You don’t have to see us to guess what we are. Because my younger sister and you had a relationship in a previous life, she’s been brought here to honor the relationship by serving you.” Wei looked at the scholar, his brocade gown and fur robe dazzling to the eyes, abashed by his own shabby appearance, and felt so shy that he didn’t know what to do. The scholar directed the maidservants to set the lanterns down, and then they all left.\n\nWei looked carefully at the young lady, who was as magnificent as a goddess, and was supremely delighted. However, he felt so ashamed of his condition, that he was unable to make clever conversation with her. The young lady looked at him with a smile, and said, “You’re not actually a scholar, so why do you make yourself look like a penniless, unfortunate student?”\n\nThen she quickly moved close to him on the bed, and warmed her hands on his chest. From that moment, Wei began to smile at her words, and after he removed his pants while they were joking with each other, they made love. At dawn, the two maidservants came to lead her away. They agreed to meet together again that night.\n\nWhen evening arrived, the lady appeared and said with a laugh, “Silly young man, what good fortune you have—you don’t have to pay a cent to have a beautiful woman come to you every night.” Wei, pleased there were no other people around, set out some wine for them to drink while they gambled and played riddle games.\n\nThe lady won nine out of ten games. Then she laughed and declared, “We’d better let me hold the things for you to guess, and then if you guess right, you’ll win; otherwise, you’ll lose. If you let me do the guessing, you won’t have any chance of winning tonight.” Following her words, they played on happily through the night.\n\nLater, when they were about to go to bed, the lady said, “Yesterday night, the quilt and mattress felt so hard and cold, I couldn’t stand it.” Then she called for her maidservants to come with perfumed, silk quilts, and to spread out the bedding, which they made soft.\n\nIn a short while, they took off their clothes and cuddled together, the lady’s mouth feeling like cream, her body fragrant, and Wei considered that even Emperor Cheng’s “gentle and soft hometown” couldn’t be better than this. Henceforward, they met together quite frequently.\n\nSix months later, Wei returned to his own household. One moonlit night, he was talking at the window with his wife, when suddenly he saw the young lady, in colorful apparel, sitting on top of a wall, beckoning to him with her hand. Wei hurried over to her.\n\nHe helped her down from the wall, and as she stepped away from it, she took his hand and told him, “It’s time now for me to leave you. Please accompany me for a few steps, to acknowledge that we’ve loved each other for these past six months.” Wei, shocked, asked her why she was doing this, and she replied, “Fate decides how long a love lasts, and there’s no need to explain further.”\n\nWhile she was speaking, they came to the outskirts of a village, where the two maidservants were carrying their pair of lanterns, waiting for them; finally they walked south to a mountain, where they climbed to a high place, and then the lady took her leave of Wei with words of farewell. Wei asked her to stay, but she declined, and then left.\n\nWei stood there uncertainly for a long time, watching them in the distance until the pair of lanterns were extinguished, and eventually he could no longer see them, so with a melancholy feeling, he returned home. That night, all of his fellow villagers could see those lights from the mountain top.",

        "body": "Li Zhuming, the son of the Suining magistrate, Li Jinzhuo, was a notable Ming official. He conducted himself forthrightly, and never lost his nerve. His wife’s elder brother, Wang Jiliang, lived in Xincheng. Wang’s family owned several pavilion towers, and frequently observed strange phenomena in them. Official Li often came to stay with them during the summer months, for he loved to cool off in the towers at night.\n\nWhen someone mentioned that strange things were going on there, he laughed, not believing them, then firmly directed that his bed be set up in one of the towers. Accordingly, his brother-in-law had this done as he’d requested. He told servants to stay with his guest in his sleeping place, but Official Li refused their company by explaining, “I like to sleep by myself, and I’ve never understood how to be afraid.”\n\nWang Jiliang directed the servants to place some sticks of incense in a burner there to help the official sleep comfortably, to ask Li which direction he wanted his feet to face as he slept on his bed, and then to blow out the candle, shut the door, and leave. Official Li had just laid down briefly in the moonlight, when he saw the cup of tea that was sitting on a stool begin to tilt and spin around, without falling over or stopping. He yelled at it, and with a loud clatter it came to a halt.\n\nThen it was as if someone was pulling the incense sticks out of the burner, and a dazzling light filled the air, sweeping over him like fireworks. The official shouted in rebuke, “Wicked ghost, how dare you do these things!” He got up from his bed, wanting to catch the ghost, but he was only partially dressed.\n\nHe stuck his foot under the bed to feel for his shoes, but only found one of them; he had no time to search for the other one, so he kicked at the incense burner with his bare feet. The incense sticks were suddenly reinserted into the burner, and it became quiet, with no sign of what had caused the activity.\n\nThe official bent down so he could feel all over the nooks and crannies obscured by the dark, when suddenly something that felt shoe-shaped leapt out and struck him on the cheek; he continued his search, but couldn’t find anything down there. Opening the door, he descended the tower, shouting for the servants to bring candles, and once the tower was illuminated, there was nothing unusual there, so again everyone tried to go to sleep.\n\nThe next day, Wang Jiliang sent several men to search the area repeatedly, turning over the mat and the bed he’d slept upon, but they just didn’t know where the shoe could be. The official’s brother-in-law exchanged the remaining shoe with a new pair of shoes for him.\n\nThe following day, when one of the servants by chance happened to look up overhead, he saw a shoe that had been placed in between the rafters; poking at it with a stick until it fell down, he discovered it to be Official Li’s other shoe.\n\nAlthough Official Li was from Yidu county, he lived in Zichuan county, in a mansion owned by a man named Sun. Sun was extremely rich, and everyone knew that many of the rooms in the spacious dwelling weren’t being used, so Official Li lived in just half of it. Its southern courtyard was near a tall pavilion, separated from it only by a wall.\n\nAt some point, he saw the door to the pavilion opening and shutting, and didn’t pay any attention to it. On another occasion, when he was engaged in conversation with some of his household members in the courtyard, the pavilion door opened, and suddenly there was a little man who faced north and sat down, his body no more than three _chi_ tall, wearing a green robe and white stockings. The household members pointed and stared at him, but he didn’t move.\n\n“This is a fox,” said Official Li. He quickly grabbed a bow and arrow, intending to shoot it into the pavilion’s door. The little man saw him, made a derisive giggling sound, and vanished. The official took a sword and went up into the pavilion, cursing, and scoured the building, until finally he couldn’t find anything, so he came back down. The strange occurrences then came to a halt.\n\nOfficial Li lived there securely for several years, and nothing weird happened. Magistrate Li Jinzhuo’s eldest son, Li Yousan, a relative of mine by marriage, witnessed the whole story.\n\nThe collector of these strange tales remarks, “Though I was born too late and never got to serve Official Li, according to what I’ve heard from the other people in my hometown, he turned out to be a fervent and resolute man. From these two situations, a general conclusion can be drawn. A man with a righteous heart will never be afraid of ghosts or foxes!”",

        "body": "Li Jinzhuo, a notable Ming official, was generous as a charitable benefactor. There was a certain villager who lived with the Li family, and worked for them as a hired hand. This man, who’d been lazy ever since he was young, wasn’t very good at farming, and hence his family was often short on money.\n\nHowever, he showed a considerable flair for certain minor tasks, and so whenever he was engaged for such services, he was always well compensated. Sometimes if he had no rice for breakfast, he would beg Magistrate Li for some, and the magistrate would always give him a _dou_ of rice.\n\nOne day, he said to Magistrate Li, “Each day I receive your generous pity, and so, fortunately, my three or four mouths to feed haven’t starved to death; but how can you keep this up forever? I beg you to loan me one _dan_ of mung beans, as the capital to start my own business.” With pleasure, the magistrate ordered that the man be given the beans. The fellow then hoisted them onto his back, and left.\n\nAfter a year had passed, he couldn’t pay back even the least part of what he’d borrowed. When he was asked about it, he answered that the money from the bean crop had already been used up. The magistrate pitied his poverty, so he didn’t demand repayment.\n\nMagistrate Li happened to be studying in a Buddhist monastery. More than three years had gone by since the loan, when one day he suddenly dreamed that the man who’d borrowed the beans had come and said to him, “I owed you the money for the beans, so now I’ve come to deliver repayment.”\n\n“If I were to demand that you repay them,” the magistrate commented to reassure him, “then what about the money you owed me on other things—how could I possibly calculate that?”\n\nThe man suddenly looked quite grave as he replied, “That’s true. An ordinary person who has worked for others, but then borrows a thousand taels because of this connection, can never hope to repay them. But if one receives financial assistance from charity, even one _dou_ of rice cannot be ignored, much less many _dous_!” When he finished speaking, he finally departed. Magistrate Li found this quite perplexing.\n\nLater, one of his family members came and reported, “During the night, our she-ass gave birth to a foal, and a big one at that.”\n\nThe magistrate suddenly asked, “What if this foal is actually that man who borrowed the beans?” Several days later, he returned home, saw the foal, and playfully called it by the debtor’s name. The foal hurried over to him, as though it recognized and remembered the name. From then on, they took to calling it by that name.\n\nMagistrate Li rode it to Qingzhou, where an advisor to Emperor Xianzong at the mansion of the governmental office was delighted with the foal, and wished to acquire it from him for a high price, though they hadn’t decided exactly what that should be. But then Li had to return home because of business that had come up.\n\nAnother year went by, and the foal was attacked by a stallion when it fed from the same trough as the horse, being bitten so hard that it broke a leg bone, and its leg couldn’t be healed. They had a veterinarian come to the magistrate’s home, and when he saw what had happened, he told them, “If you hand this foal over to me, I’ll try to cure it, though it’ll take some time to do this. When it recovers, I’ll sell it, and give you half of the proceeds.” Magistrate Li agreed that this seemed fair.\n\nAfter several months, the veterinarian sold the donkey for him, being paid 1,800 taels for it, and delivered half of the amount to Magistrate Li. When he received the money, he suddenly realized that it was exactly the value of the beans that the debtor had borrowed.\n\nAlas! A debt from the mortal world had to be repaid by a spirit in the underworld—yet this example should be enough to provide a lesson for us.",

She kept calling out to her “son.” The family members were all aware that something odd was going on.\n\nAt that time, the coffin containing the remains of Du’s mother hadn’t yet been carried to burial, so he began to suspect that her ghost was possessing his wife.

She’s supposed to die; there are four people who’ve been assigned to take custody of her, and the leader among them is named Zhang Huaiyu. I tried various means to beg them for pity, until I just now was finally able to secure their cooperation.

Your mother is too old to take care of all the housework necessary for it. And when the time arrives, I’ll need my daughter-in-law to help out.”\n\n“The mortal world and the underworld are such different places,” Du marveled, “how can it be possible that she can help cook from the underworld?

Fortunately, father-in-law pled with them pitifully, and even paid them bribes to leave. I saw that father-in-law had two more metal bars of money wrapped up in cloth, and I wanted to filch one of them, so I might be able to use it to support us. Father-in-law spied me looking, and scolded me, ‘What are you trying to do! How do you suppose you’d be able to use these things!’ Then I held my hand still and didn’t dare move.”\n\nAssuming that his wife was near death, Du half believed and half doubted what he’d heard. When three days had elapsed, as she was talking and laughing with him, she suddenly opened her eyes widely, staring for a long while, and then said, “Your wife is extremely covetous, and when she saw my silver, she eyed it greedily. However, since your life has been a hard one, I forgave her. Now I’ll take her away to do the cooking job for me, and there’ll be nothing more to worry about.” Just as she finished speaking, she suddenly died.\n\nAfter about half a day had elapsed, she began to revive, and told Du, “Father-in-law called me to come and help, and said, ‘You don’t have to do any of the preparation work, since I have others to do the cooking—you only need to sit calmly, and tell them what to do to your satisfaction. In the underworld, we like all the food dishes, plates and bowls to be filled till they’re overflowing, so be sure to remember that.’ I promised I would.\n\n“When I arrived at the kitchen, I saw two women holding knives over cutting boards, wearing reddish-black capes with green fringe, who called me sister-inlaw. Every time they put food in the dishes, they asked me to check them for approval. The four persons had already been seated for the feast. When all of the dishes had been prepared and displayed, and all of the wine and wine vessels had been set in order, father-in-law ordered me to come back.” Du was stunned by the strangeness of it all, and often commented on this to others.",

He heard that there was a certain fox who lived in a house in the city, so he courteously took a visiting card and went to pay a visit, looking forward to meeting the fox.\n\nHe delivered his visiting card at the gate. Moments later, the door opened. The servant there looked quite startled, stepped back and withdrew. Zhang, who tidied his clothes respectfully, entered politely, and saw that a stool and couch had been set compliantly in the main room, though no one was there in the silence, so he bowed with his hands clasped and offered his greetings, saying, “I have fasted to show my respect, and have now arrived, and since I haven’t been kept outside to deny my seeing you, why haven’t I been conducted into your gloriously immortal presence?”\n\nSuddenly he heard a voice speak in the empty room, replying, “I was grateful and honored by your visit as soon as I heard the sound of your footsteps, so please have a seat, and I’ll be happy to talk with you.”\n\nThen he saw the two seats move face to face by themselves. Just as he sat down, an engraved, scarlet lacquer tray, holding a pair of cups of fragrant tea, appeared before his eyes. They each picked up a cup and drank, making slurping sounds, but still Zhang couldn’t see anyone there.\n\nWhen the tea was finished, they proceeded on to wine. Zhang delicately inquired about his host’s family, and the voice replied, “In the Hu family, I am the fourth child; you may call me ‘young master,’ as my followers do.” Hence they exchanged toasts and discussed matters, their temperaments in complete harmony.\n\nThey enjoyed delicacies like turtle meat and venison, seasoned with a variety of spices. Those who served them with wine and meat seemed to be the young master’s servants. After they’d finished their wine, Zhang had just begun to think about the delicious tea again, when he noticed that cups of the fragrant tea had already been placed on the stool. Whenever he thought of something, without exception, his thoughts would be complied with, and it would appear. Zhang was greatly pleased, and once he’d become drunk, he went home.\n\nFrom then on, every three days or so, he would visit Hu, and sometimes Hu visited him in return, so they shared the courtesy of being host and guest.\n\nOne day, Zhang inquired of Hu, “There’s an old witch woman at the south wall of the city, and each day she employs a fox spirit to extort money from people. I don’t know anything about it, but do you happen to know this fox?”\n\n“That’s ridiculous,” replied Hu, “there’s not really a fox.”\n\nA little later, when Zhang got up to urinate, he heard a small voice say, “Just now you mentioned the witch woman at the city’s south wall that you didn’t know much about. I’d like to follow you and observe her, so I wonder if I might trouble you to put the request to my master.”\n\nZhang knew it was a small fox who was speaking to him, so he replied, “I’d be glad to.” He returned to his place inside, and told Hu, “I’d respectfully like to request to enlist one or two of your people to go with me to investigate this fox witch, if you’ll authorize it.” Hu firmly said there was no need for him to do so. Zhang made his request over and over again, till finally his host gave his permission.\n\nSubsequently, when Zhang went outside, a horse was already there, as though someone was holding it, waiting for him. Hence he mounted it to head off on his way, while Hu advised him, “Later on, when you’re walking along the road, you’ll begin to feel a fine sand falling on the front of your jacket, and that will be my servant.”\n\nFollowing these words, Zhang entered the city walls and came to the witch’s home. When she spotted Zhang arriving, she laughed derisively, and demanded, “Why would you, a respectable gentleman, suddenly decide to come here?”\n\n“I’ve heard that you have a powerful fox in your employ,” replied Zhang, “so is that true?”\n\nThe witch looked at him sharply and exclaimed, “Such words of disrespect are unsuitable coming from a gentleman! Why would you blatantly call her a fox? I’m afraid my sister will be unhappy about this!”\n\nBefore her words had even finished, half a stone floor tile appeared from thin air, and fell into the witch’s arms, causing her to stagger under its weight like she might fall. Frightened, she said to Zhang, “Your Honor, why have you thrown this at me?”\n\nLaughing, Zhang said, “You old crone, you must be blind! When have you ever seen a person’s head broken without that person blaming someone else, who’s doing nothing but standing there with empty hands?” The witch was startled, and didn’t know how to get out of the situation. Just as she was turning around in confusion, another piece of stone fell and hit her on top of the head; she fell down, and the filthy mud on the stone slid off and smeared the witch’s face, making her look like a demon. All she could do was wail, and beg for her life. Zhang asked that she be forgiven, and then the activity stopped.\n\nThe witch anxiously stood up and ran off, fleeing into her house, where she closed the door and didn’t dare come out. Zhang called out to her, “Is your fox like my fox?” The witch merely apologized for her wrongdoing. Zhang raised his head and looked up into the sky, exhorting the fox not to wound the witch again, and the witch, who’d been fearfully observing all this, then came back out. Zhang smiled, gave her strict instructions, and then returned to Hu’s place.\n\nAfter this, Zhang often went out alone for a walk along that road. Whenever he felt the dust blowing past him, he’d call for the servant fox, and it always responded to him, without fail. Bandits and brigands could count on him not to be afraid of them.\n\nIn this way, a year went by, and Zhang grew closer and closer to Hu in friendship. Whenever he asked Hu his age, the fox told him he couldn’t recall, though he’d also say, “I can still see Huang Chao’s rebellion, as though it was only yesterday.”\n\nOne night they were speaking together, when suddenly something on top of the wall stirred and made a strident noise. Zhang thought it strange, and Hu explained, “That must be my elder brother.”\n\n“Aren’t you going to invite him to come and sit with us?” asked Zhang.\n\n“His Daoist skills are rather deficient,” Hu replied, “thus he’s only good at snatching and eating chickens, so don’t worry about him.”\n\n“A friendship as strong as ours means that we can always speak without regret,” Zhang told Hu; “but it would be a sad thing if I never get to see your face.”\n\n“A good friendship is enough,” Hu commented, “so why must we see each other face to face?”\n\nOne day, Hu set out some wine and invited Zhang over, in order to bid farewell to him. “Where are you going?” asked Zhang.\n\nHu explained, “I was born in Shan, and I’m leaving to return there. You’ve always regretted not seeing me face to face, and now I’ll let you see me, so you’ll be able to recognize me later when we meet again.” Zhang looked around everywhere, but couldn’t see him. “When you try to open the bedroom door,” Hu said, “I will be there.”\n\nZhang then pushed open the door and peeked in, and inside there was a handsome young man who met him with a glance and a smile. His clothing was splendid, his features like something from a painting, and after winking at Zhang, he simply vanished.\n\nZhang turned around and heard the sound of nearby footsteps following him, as Hu’s voice said, “Today all your regrets will be settled.” Zhang was reluctant to leave, since he couldn’t bear to part from Hu. “Separations and reunions are fated,” said Hu, “so there’s no point in letting them upset you.”\n\nThen he took an enormous drinking vessel and suggested that they have some wine. They drank until evening fell, and then Hu took a screened lantern and led Zhang home. The next day, Zhang went back to Hu’s house, but it was unoccupied, utterly deserted.\n\nLater, his younger brother, Zhang Daoyi, was promoted to become a Xichuan official, though Zhang Xuyi himself was as poor as before. He went to visit his younger brother in hopes that he might receive some valuable gifts from him. After over a month, he returned home, his hopes unsatisfied, so he sighed dejectedly from horseback.\n\nSuddenly a young man riding a dark colt caught up with him. Zhang looked back, saw that the horse was extremely beautiful, and also thought it quite graceful, then spoke up, and the young man scrutinized the unhappy Zhang and asked him who he was. Zhang then sighed, and told him. The young man proceeded then to comfort him.\n\nThey rode together for about three _li_, till they came to a fork in the road, and the young man saluted Zhang respectfully with cupped hands to take his leave, saying, “There’s a man in the road ahead with something for you from your old friend, who asks that you kindly accept it.” Zhang wanted to inquire about it, but the young man’s horse quickly galloped away. Zhang didn’t understand what it all meant.\n\nHe rode another two or three _li_, then spotted a servant holding a small basket, which he presented when Zhang’s horse stopped in front of him, declaring, “Young Master Hu the Fourth respectfully sends you this, sir.” Zhang suddenly realized the truth. He accepted the basket, opened it to look inside, and found it was filled with silver currency.\n\nHe then turned to look for the servant, but he was nowhere to be seen.",

        "title": "Confidence Schemes",
        "body": "The collector of these strange tales notes that no matter where one lives, there are deceitful and treacherous people everywhere; and if they occupy the main south-north thoroughfares, their evil-doing is especially vicious. If they have a strong bow and a powerful horse, they’ll attract people outside the cities, and then rob them. Sometimes they’ll cut off your purse, slash it open, and steal your goods in the marketplace, so when you turn around to look, your money and property are gone—what is this, but the work of deceitful and treacherous men?\n\nThen again, by chance while traveling, you may meet someone whose words are as pleasant as sweet wine, and who leads you into a trap, gradually but deeply. You make the mistake of treating them as friends, talking with them during the trip, and then you face the disaster of losing all your money to them. The traps are set up randomly, in different settings; the term for this kind of deception is a “confidence scheme.” Now that there are so many people traveling along the roads to the north, an even greater number of victims will suffer from their evil.\n\nWang Zixun had just passed the first level of the civil service examination in Zichuan. He had an older relative who served in the capital as an official in the imperial Hanlin Academy, so he decided to look him up and visit him. He prepared all the necessities for his journey, and then headed northward out of Jinan.\n\nAfter he’d traveled several _li_, a man appeared, riding a black donkey, and began traveling along with him. After a while, they began chatting together as they rode, with Wang readily responding to the man’s inquiries. The man then volunteered, “My surname is Zhang, I work in the government office in Qixie, and I’ve been sent on an official errand to the capital.” He referred to himself modestly, and seemed to hold Wang in great respect with his eager attentiveness.\n\nHe rode along with Wang for quite a few _li_, then wanted to share a lodging with Wang for the night. Whenever Wang got ahead of him, Zhang caught up with him after whipping his donkey to speed up; if Wang lagged behind him, Zhang waited upon him respectfully, all along the way. Wang’s servant thought this suspicious, and with a stern look on his face, he refused to go any further as long as Zhang was together with them. Zhang, who seemed to feel quite hurt by this, flourished his whip and left.\n\nAt sunset, they stopped at an inn, and as they walked through the front entrance, they saw Zhang drinking just outside the inn. They were surprised and wary, and as Zhang saw Wang approaching in the distance, he stood respectfully at attention, in all humility, as if he were a servant; then gradually he began to inquire about their journey. Wang also treated their running into each other again as mere coincidence, so he was no longer suspicious, though his servant remained on guard all night long.\n\nAt the cock’s crow, Zhang showed up and declared his intention of traveling along with them. The servant loudly rejected the idea, and so Zhang left. The morning sun was already up, so Wang embarked on his journey.\n\nThey traveled till almost noon, when they met a man at least forty years old, riding ahead of them on a white donkey, his clothes and hat both clean and tidy; his head hung down as he rode, like he was asleep and about to fall off. Either in front or behind, they traveled together for ten _li_ or so. Wang found it strange, and asked, “What did you do last night, to make you so sleepy now?”\n\nWhen the man heard this, he abruptly yawned and stretched, saying, “I’m from Qingyuan, and my surname’s Xu. The Linzi county magistrate, Gao Qing, is my first cousin. My elder brother has set up a school in the government office building, so I’m going to visit, and maybe receive a little gift from him. Last night, I stayed at an inn, and in order not to be taken in by the same confidence scheme, I stayed on guard and didn’t dare close my eyes, concentrating until sunrise, so now I’m rather disoriented and exhausted.”\n\n“What confidence scheme are you talking about?” asked Wang.\n\nXu explained, “Because you haven’t often stayed outside the cities, you wouldn’t know how dangerous and deceitful it is out here. These days, there’s a certain kind of bandit who uses fine words to induce a traveler to stop and stay overnight at the same lodgings he chooses, thereupon seizing the opportunity to swindle the traveler. Yesterday, a distant relative of mine ended up losing his traveling money this way. We should all be cautious and prepared.” Wang nodded in response.\n\nBefore all this began, the Linzi magistrate and Wang had long been friends, and Wang had been inside Magistrate Gao’s office, so he remembered that Gao had a family member named Xu, and thus was no longer suspicious. Then he greeted Xu more warmly, and inquired further about Xu’s elder brother.\n\nXu invited Wang to stay in the same inn with him, and Wang accepted. Wang’s servant, however, suspected that Xu was a confidence man, so he secretly discussed this with his master, asking him to linger there and go no further. Thus Wang told Xu he’d have to turn him down after all, and then they were left alone.\n\nAt noon the next day, Wang and his servant met a young man, about sixteen or seventeen years old, riding a robust-looking mule, his cap and clothing elegant and neat, and extremely handsome in appearance. They traveled together for a long time, but never exchanged a word. When the sun was starting to set in the west, the young man suddenly said, “If you’re going to the Qulü Inn, it’s not far.” Wang responded casually to him.\n\nThe young man just heaved a heavy sigh, as though he felt terribly depressed. Wang tersely asked him what was wrong. With another sigh, the young man replied, “I’m from Jiangnan, and my surname is Jin. I paid tuition fees and studied for three years, looking forward to finishing in first place, but then, unexpectedly, I failed the examination! My elder brother oversees the Six Ministries, and therefore I’m bringing my wife and family members to visit him, and I look forward to relaxing at his place, but I’ve never made such a long journey before, with the dust blowing in my face, and it bothers me.” Accordingly, he wiped his face with a red scarf, while sighing over and over.\n\nWang heard that Jin spoke in southern dialect, with his voice sounding as lovely and delicate as a woman’s. Wang liked him, and gradually tried comforting him. Jin replied, “I rode out ahead of them by myself, and I’ve waited a long time for them to come, so why haven’t they come yet? It’s almost sunset already—what am I to do!” They kept looking off into the distance, and slowed their speed considerably. Wang then rode over to him and they left, gradually separating from each other as they rode far away.\n\nThat night, Wang stopped at an inn, and when he walked into his room, he found a bed against the wall, with another guest’s bag resting on it. Wang asked for the caretaker. Promptly, a man entered, carried the bag out, and said, “Please just take that bed, and I’ll move my things somewhere else immediately.” Wang saw that the man was Xu, so Wang stopped him from leaving, and Xu stayed with him in the same room. Thence he began chatting informally with him.\n\nIn a short while, another man, carrying his own bag, entered the room. Seeing Wang with Xu in the room, he turned around and hastily left, saying, “There’s already a guest there.” Wang examined him closely, and found that it was the young man he’d met on the way. Wang didn’t say anything, and when Xu quickly got up to drag Jin back in to stay, the young man came and took a seat.\n\nXu then proceeded to ask about Jin’s background, and the young man responded to him just as he had responded to Wang earlier. In a few moments, Jin opened a bag and took out a rather hefty pile of money; he then took a few taels and paid them to the caretaker, telling him to bring them some snacks and wine to enjoy during their evening’s conversation. The other two men both told him not to bother, but he wouldn’t hear of it.\n\nAfter a while, wine and meat were set out. Over this feast, Jin discussed literature with considerable elegance. When Wang asked about the topics assigned in the Jiangnan examination hall, Jin described them in detail. He then recited the second section of his own eight-part essay, as well as some other sentences of which he was proud. When he finished reciting, he hinted that his being failed was a great injustice. The others commiserated with him.\n\nJin then turned to the fact that his family was still missing, that at night there wouldn’t be any servants to assist him, and that he worried about who would feed his donkey. Wang thus ordered his servant to have some fodder prepared for the donkey. Jin expressed his deeply felt thanks.\n\nIn the room shortly afterwards, Jin anxiously declared, “Nothing has ever gone smoothly for me my entire life, and the circumstances of this journey have been no better. Last night there was a vile man staying at our inn, playing dice and shouting, his noise putting everyone in a bad mood, since no one could get to sleep.” In his southern dialect, he pronounced the character for “dice” so it sounded like the character for “bag,” and Xu claimed he couldn’t understand him, and asked him what he meant. With his hand, Jin pantomimed that he was rolling some dice.\n\nXu then laughed, pulled a pair of dice out of a bag, and said, “Are these what you mean?” Jin acknowledged that they were. Taking the dice, Xu had the others throw to see how many cups of wine each of them should drink, and then they proceeded to drink together merrily.\n\nAs they neared the end of their drinking, Xu proposed that they toss the dice to determine who would treat the others to dinner. Wang declined, claiming he didn’t understand the rules of gambling. Xu accordingly asked Jin to gamble with him.\n\nThen he covertly told Wang, “Be careful with your words. This young gentleman is quite well-to-do, and young in years as well, so he may not have developed much of a knack for gambling. I’ll win a little bit from him, then offer him a feast, and I’ll invite you to come, too.” Then they went into the next room.\n\nBefore long, they began gambling very noisily, while Wang stealthily watched, noticing that the Qixie official, Zhang, was standing between Jin and Xu. Extremely suspicious, Wang spread out a quilt and lay down upon the bed. Then in a little while, the group tried to draw Wang into gambling with them. Wang firmly declined, saying he didn’t understand gambling. Though Xu expressed his willingness to tally the dice rolls for him so he’d win, Wang still wouldn’t agree to play,\n\nThen they decided to throw the dice for him themselves. Soon they approached Wang’s bed and told him, “You’d have won some money.” In response, Wang just fell asleep.\n\nSuddenly, several men pushed the door open and entered, babbling in an unfamiliar dialect. Their chief said his surname was Tong, and that their task was to patrol the community and arrest any gamblers. At that time, gambling was very strictly forbidden, so each of the men was quite terrified. Tong threatened Wang in a loud voice, and Wang defiantly responded by stating the titles held by his family.\n\nThis dispelled Tong’s anger, for he said that he, too, came from Wang’s hometown, and laughingly invited Wang to resume gambling. The group consequently returned to their gambling, with Tong joining in. Wang told Xu, “Win or lose, I won’t have anything to do with it. I only want to sleep, so don’t bother me with your activities.” Xu ignored him, and they resumed playing as before.\n\nWhen they finished their gaming, each of them tallied up their counters, and they concluded that Wang owed them a lot of money. Tong then started searching through Wang’s clothes and bag to find payment. Wang angrily got up and started fighting with them.\n\nJin grabbed Wang’s arm, and whispered to him, “They’re all bandits, and their actions are unpredictable. But we’re united by our literary tastes, so we have to look out for each other. Just now, I won some money, which can make up your loss. In fact, my money was won from Xu, so now I’ll ask them to switch it, so Xu pays Tong and you pay me. I’ll pretend to take your money to make them believe us, and later I’ll return the money to you. We’re moral friends; how could I take your money otherwise?” Wang was honest by nature, and trusted Jin.\n\nThe young man then went over to the others, and proposed the exchange plan to Tong. Afterwards, he opened up Wang’s things in front of the others, to estimate how much they were worth. Tong turned and demanded his share from Xu and Zhang, then departed.\n\nJin then took his bedding and put his pillow next to Wang’s; the large quilt and mattress were both quite elegant. Wang also asked his servant to lay down on the bed, and each of them lay there silently, resting. After a long time, Jin pretended to turn over on his side, then exposed his private parts and moved towards the servant. The servant moved his body away to avoid him; Jin again moved close to him, his skin touching the edge of the servant’s thighs, which were as satiny as rendered fat.\n\nThe servant felt him trying to engage in sex with him; and Jin was ardently attentive, so much so that he used the large quilt to stifle the servant’s aroused moans. Wang heard something going on, and though he was very confused, in the end he didn’t suspect that Jin was actually trying to do anything to his servant.\n\nAt dawn, Jin promptly got up, hurrying to get an early start. He said to Wang, “Your donkey is tired, so I’ll leave earlier than you, and in the middle of the road ahead, I’ll return the things I took from you last night.” Wang didn’t have time to say anything, and Jin had already packed everything up, so he mounted and rode out. Wang had no choice but to follow him. However, the mule took off quickly, and receded gradually into the distance.\n\nWang originally thought that Jin must be waiting for him in the road up ahead, so he didn’t worry about it. Hence he asked his servant about what had been going on during the night, and the servant told him the whole truth. Genuinely shocked then, Wang exclaimed, “Now I understand that we’ve been tricked by confidence men! Would a reputable man from a high-ranking family volunteer his sexual services to a servant?” Yet when he reconsidered the elegance of Jin’s sentences during their conversation, it seemed that they couldn’t have come from a confidence man.\n\nHe quickly chased after Jin for about ten _li_, without finding any traces of him. It dawned on him that Zhang, Xu, and Tong, were all part of a single gang, and since they couldn’t trap him with their first trick, they conceived another trick to be sure to deceive him. The plan for exchanging the gambling debts was simply a trap to ensnare him; and if their schemes to carry off his belongings hadn’t worked out, they could’ve just seized them by force and left.\n\nOn the other hand, in order to cheat him out of ten taels, they’d followed him for over a hundred _li_; and to prevent the servant from revealing their trickery, Jin had sex with him—altogether, their technique had been painfully successful.\n\nSome years later, there was another such incident that happened to Scholar Wu.\n\nIn our town, there was a Scholar Wu, whose courtesy name was Anren. At the age of thirty, he’d lost his wife, so he lived alone in an empty study. There was a _xiucai_ who came to speak with him, and they were pleased by each other’s company. The _xiucai_ was accompanied by a young servant named Guitou, who also got along quite happily with Wu’s boy servant, Bao’er. It didn’t take long for Wu to realize that Guitou and his master were foxes. Wherever Wu traveled, the _xiucai_ fox went along with him. Though they were in the same room together, no one but Wu could see the fox.\n\nWhen Wu had been staying in the capital and was just about to return home, he heard that Scholar Wang had been the victim of a confidence scheme, and so he warned Bao’er to be ready for anything. Guitou laughed and said, “No need—this trip will definitely be a profitable one.”\n\nAt Zhizhuo, a man tethered his horse and then sat down in a tobacco shop, dressed in neat, distinctive furs. When he saw Wu pass, he got up and mounted his horse to follow him. Eventually he caught up to speak with him, and told Wu, “I’m Huang, from Shandong, a special official delivering a document to the Ministry of Revenue. Since I’m just about to head east to return home, I’d be delighted if we might travel together, so it won’t be a lonely trip.”\n\nThereafter, whenever Wu stopped somewhere, Huang stopped; they always ate together, with Wu paying for it. Wu was outwardly cordial and inwardly suspicious. He secretly asked his fox friend his opinion, and the fox replied, “There’s no harm in it.” This dispelled Wu’s worries.\n\nAs evening approached, they were looking over a particular place to stay, and there was a young man at the time sitting inside. Huang entered, and was greeted with respectful courtesy. He happily asked the young man, “How long have you been away from the capital?”\n\n“Since yesterday,” he replied.\n\nHuang then talked the young man into staying with them. He turned towards Wu and said, “This is Master Shi, my younger cousin, who’s also a man of letters and can join in your literary discussions, so tonight the conversation won’t be one-sided.” Then he took out some money to spend on drinks for all of them. Shi’s literary tastes were cultured and refined, so Wu found himself becoming quite fond of him.\n\nWhile they were drinking, Shi kept hinting with his eyes that they should pull a trick on Huang with a game, so they penalized Huang, and forced him to drain a goblet of wine, applauding with laughter as he did so. Wu became even more amused by Shi.\n\nAfterwards, Shi and Huang decided they wanted to gamble, and they pulled at Wu to come along with them, then each of them took out money from their wallets to serve as the gambling stakes. The fox advised Bao’er to lock the door, and then warned Wu, “If you hear loud voices, just pretend like you’re sleeping, and didn’t hear any disturbance.” Wu promised to do so.\n\nWhenever Wu rolled the dice, the small numbers were losers and large numbers were winners. In a little more than two hours, they calculated that he’d won two hundred taels. Shi and Huang found that the money in their bags was almost all gone, so they discussed pawning their horses.\n\nSuddenly they heard the sound of a very stern knocking at the door, so Wu anxiously stood up, flung the dice into the fire, covered himself with a quilt, and pretended to be asleep. A long time passed till he heard the innkeeper hunting unsuccessfully for the key to the room, then someone forced the door open, and several men agitatedly rushed in, searching for gamblers to arrest. Shi and Huang in unison declared that there weren’t any in the room.\n\nOne man finally rubbed his hand over Wu’s quilt, pointing out to them a gambler beneath it. Wu shouted his denial at him. The men violently ransacked Wu’s belongings. Just as they were proving unable to open his case, suddenly they heard the sound of a government official arriving with horses and staff.\n\nWu anxiously ran through the door and cried out, and the group inside, growing afraid, dragged him back in, begging him not to make a sound. Wu then calmly packed his bag and handed it to the innkeeper. The official’s procession outside then went away, and the gang of men still inside then rushed out the door and fled.\n\nHuang and Shi expressed their terror and relief to each other, then prepared to go to bed. Huang directed Shi to share a bed with Wu. Wu removed his money bag from his waist and put it beside his pillow, then called for his quilt and went to sleep.\n\nBefore long, Shi lifted up Wu’s quilt and slipped in next to him, naked, saying in a low voice, “I love you openly, and I just want us to be close friends.” Wu knew that this was part of some plan to swindle him, but despite the scheming, Shi was also good company, and thus Wu let him cuddle with him.\n\nShi spared no effort in ardently arousing Wu, but, unexpectedly, Wu turned out to be a robust man, and it was hard for him to enter Shi, who was moaning in pain. In a low voice, Shi begged him to stop; however, Wu just wanted to be satisfied and done with it. He checked Shi with both hands, and found that Shi had bled quite a bit. Then he released him to go back to his place on the bed.\n\nThe next morning, Shi was so exhausted that he couldn’t rise; when they helped him up, he said he’d experienced a sudden attack of illness, then begged Wu and Huang to go on ahead without him. Just before parting, Wu offered him some money to cover his expenses for medicine.\n\nEn route, while speaking with his fox friend, Wu realized that the procession that had shown up during the night was entirely the fox’s doing.\n\nOn the way, Huang fawned upon Wu even more. At dusk, they again shared lodging at an inn together, in a small, very narrow room, that contained only one bed; but it was quite warm and clean, though Wu thought it was narrow for him. Huang told Wu, “This is rather narrow for two people to lay on it, but it would be spacious for you alone, so why don’t you take it for yourself?” When they finished eating, Huang left straightaway.\n\nWu was quite happy to lodge alone, so he could have time together with his fox friend. He sat around for a good long while, but the fox didn’t appear. Suddenly, through the room’s window he heard the sound of fingers rapping. Wu pulled open the door to see what was going on, and a flashily-dressed young woman rushed in, bolted the door, and turned towards Wu with a broad smile, beautiful as a fairy.\n\nWu happily began asking her questions, and learned that she was the innkeeper’s daughter-in-law. Then they began making love, mutually passionate. The girl suddenly burst into tears and started crying. Startled, Wu asked her what was wrong, and she replied, “I can’t bear to hide the fact that the innkeeper sent me here to seduce you. In the past, as soon as I entered a room, they‘d break in, so why haven’t they shown up after all this time tonight?”\n\nWith a choked sob, she continued, “I’m the daughter of a respectable family, and I’m doing this against my will. Now that I’ve already fallen in love with you, I’m begging you to take me away from here!” Wu heard this and was frightened by what she’d said, but he didn’t know what to do, so he asked her to leave quickly. The girl merely bowed her head and wept.\n\nSuddenly he heard Huang and the innkeeper noisily beating at the door. Then he heard Huang say, “I’ve treated you with respect the whole way, and thought you were a moral man, so why have you seduced my brother’s wife!” Wu was shocked, and pressed the girl to leave immediately.\n\nThe sound of someone outside pounding on his door continued. Sweating copiously, Wu tried to hurry her up, but the girl just lay on the floor, crying. Then they heard someone advise the innkeeper to stop. The innkeeper wouldn’t listen, and continued beating even more urgently.\n\nThe advising voice responded, “Excuse me, sir, but why are you acting this way? It’s as though you want to kill someone, and now that we’re here, we won’t let you get away with such ruffian behavior. If one of the two people in a room runs away, how can you hold the person left behind as the guilty one? If you bring this matter to court, you’ll be humiliating yourself by revealing the ugly matter in public. Moreover, it’s obvious that you’re trying to deceive your guests, so how can you be sure that the young lady won’t expose your crime?” The innkeeper was so stunned, he couldn’t argue with the advice.\n\nWhen Wu heard this, he privately felt gratitude and admiration for the man who was speaking, though he didn’t know who he was.\n\nEarlier, just as the establishment’s doors were about to close, the _xiucai_ and Guitou arrived outside. They brought in some fragrant wine and began pouring it for everyone inside the inn, warmly urging Huang and the innkeeper to drink. When the two men declined and wanted to get up, the _xiucai_ pulled at their robes, taking pains to ensure they didn’t leave. Later, the two took advantage of his carelessness to slip away, grab a stick, and hurry to Wu’s room. When the _xiucai_ heard their noise, he intervened to mediate.\n\nWu hid near a window and peered out, saw that the advisor was his fox friend, and privately felt relieved. Then Wu watched the innkeeper act like he still wanted to come after him, till the fox loudly intimidated the man. Wu asked the girl, “Don’t you have anything to say?”\n\n“I’m really not like these people,” she replied, weeping. “They forced me to be part of their sordid business!” When the innkeeper heard this, his face turned pale as burnt ashes.\n\nCursing him, the _xiucai_ declared, “You swindlers are beasts, and your scheme’s been exposed. Your guests are all outraged!” Huang and the innkeeper both tried to put aside the knife and stick they were holding, kneeling for a long time as they begged for mercy.\n\nWu opened the door, came out, and suddenly began berating them furiously. The _xiucai_ advised Wu to stop, and the two sides were reconciled. The girl started to cry again, saying she’d rather die than go back to doing this. From inside, an old maidservant hurried out, grabbed the girl, and ordered her to go in. The girl slumped to the ground, weeping even more pitifully.\n\nThe _xiucai_ recommended that the innkeeper sell the girl to Master Wu for a good price. The innkeeper bowed his head and said, “One can be a mother for thirty years, and then there’s the day one becomes a newborn baby.” Then he complied with the _xiucai_’s advice.\n\nWu was adamantly unwilling to pay a fairly high price; the _xiucai_ arbitrated the matter between host and guest, and they settled upon the sum of fifty taels. Once Wu had paid the amount specified, it was already well into the morning, so they hurriedly packed their things and prepared to take the girl with them.\n\nThe girl, who had never ridden a saddled horse, galloped off rather perilously. At noon, they took a bit of a rest. As they were about to go, they called for Bao’er, but they didn’t know where he’d gone. By the time the sun had already begun to slant towards the west, there still weren’t any signs or sounds of him, so feeling rather worried and anxious, Wu asked the fox about it. “Don’t worry,” said the fox, “he’s just about here.”\n\nThe moon and stars were already out when Bao’er finally arrived. Wu asked him where he’d been, and with a laugh, Bao’er replied, “You gave fifty taels to those treacherous villains, and I felt that was unfair to you. Accordingly, I decided with Guitou to go and demand it back.” Then he took those taels out and placed them on a small table.\n\nWu was surprised and asked Bao’er to explain, but Guitou told him that the girl had an elder brother, who’d been away for over ten years, and he magically transformed himself to look like the brother, while making Bao’er pretend to be a younger brother, as they entered the inn and demanded to see their sister.\n\nThe innkeeper had been terrified, so he cunningly lied that she’d been sick and had died. The two brothers wanted to question an official about the matter, so the innkeeper, even more frightened, enticed them with a payoff, gradually increasing the amount to forty taels, and then the two finally left. As Bao’er finished telling their story, Wu then rewarded the servants with additional taels.\n\nWu returned home with the girl, and they lived in genuine marital harmony. His family grew even more affluent. As he asked the girl for more details about her past, she said that she was the wife of the handsome young man, Shi. The short silk cape that she wore was one she received from a Shandong man named Wang. She explained that Shi, Huang, and the innkeeper were all members of a gang.\n\nWho would have expected that the criminals Wu met were the same ones who had cheated Wang Zixun, and caused his unfortunate suffering! How true, indeed, is the ancient saying, “Riding a horse is a good way to take a fall.”",

When she recognized that her husband wasn’t as capable as other men, she glumly realized that her ambitions in life wouldn’t be fulfilled. Nevertheless, she remained faithful and pure, and lived peacefully with her mother-in-law.\n\nOne night, while alone in her room, she suddenly heard the wind blow the door open, and a scholar entered, took off his jacket and scarf, and came near the wife, intending that they would sleep together. The frightened wife refused, struggling bitterly with the man; but her muscles suddenly went weak, and she heard him forcing himself on her, after which he left. Subsequently, he returned every night without fail.\n\nThis continued for a month, and she began to look thin and tired. Chen’s mother found this quite odd. In the beginning, the wife simply felt ashamed, and didn’t want to say anything about what’d happened; but when Chen’s mother insistently asked her about it, she finally gave in to her inquiries, and told her.\n\nShocked, the mother cried, “This must be some goblin!” She performed numerous magical spells, trying with her incantations to prevent the scholar from returning, but in the end she couldn’t keep him away. Then they called for Chen Dai, and hid him in the wife’s room, where he waited with a wooden club.\n\nAt midnight, the scholar returned, and set his hat on a low table; once again, he took off his clothes and hung them on a rack. Just as the scholar wanted to climb onto the wife’s bed, he suddenly cried in terror, “Uh-oh! There’s someone else here!” He anxiously began putting his clothes back on.\n\nChen Dai sprang up from his hiding place, and when he struck the scholar in the kidneys and ribs, it sounded like he was striking something hard. Once he and his wife went searching around the room for him, they discovered that the scholar had already disappeared. When they lit a fire to check more closely, on the floor they found a piece of clothing made from earth, while an earthen scholar’s cap was still where it had been placed on the table.",

He tried to provoke her with some sexually suggestive language, which she seemed quite happy to accept from him. He really wanted to make love with her, but there was no good place for them to meet just then, so he asked her to visit him that night. Accordingly, Wang told her where he lived.\n\nWhen night fell, she showed up there, and they got along very well, immediately becoming quite fond of each other. When Wang asked the woman her full name, she flatly refused to tell him. After that night, they continued seeing each other regularly.\n\nAbout that time, while Wang and his wife were sleeping in the same bed, the beautiful woman also came to make love with him, and yet his wife seemed unconscious of the fact that anyone else was there. Surprised, Wang asked the beauty about it. “I’m the earth god’s wife,” she replied.\n\nWang became terrified, and earnestly wanted to call it quits, but even after trying a hundred ways to break up with her, he couldn’t do it. This pattern went on for six months, till Wang was so exhausted that he became very ill. The earth god’s wife began coming to him more frequently, and all of his family members could see her. As a result, Wang soon died.\n\nThe earth god’s wife continued to show up each day. Wang’s wife finally shouted in rebuke, “Demon of lust, have you no shame! A man has already died because of you, so why do you keep coming back here?” The beauty then left, and never returned.\n\nEven if he was a rather minor figure, the earth god was also a deity, so since heaven gave him this appointment, how could he allow his wife to be unfaithful to him? Her wanton behavior shouldn’t have been allowed to go so far. I don’t know what kind of lewd creature she was, to cause the village descendants for generations to say that there’s a dirty, cheap, insincere god there. What an injustice!",

        "title": "The Daoist from Jinan",
        "body": "There was a Daoist from Jinan, though I don’t know what kind of person he was, or what his name was. All year long, he wore a thin, unlined robe, fastened with a yellow silk ribbon, and no leggings or jacket. He always used just a half a comb to comb his hair, then coiled his hair and inserted the comb to anchor it, so it looked like a hat. By day, he walked barefooted through the market; by night, he laid down in the street, and the ice and snow melted away from around him for several _chi_. As soon as he’d arrive, he’d always treat people to exhibitions of his magic, and so the townspeople contended with each other to offer him gifts of charity.\n\nThere was a rascally young scoundrel in the market who left the Daoist some wine, and demanded that he teach him some magic, but the Daoist wouldn’t permit it. When he ran across the Daoist later, taking a bath in the river near a crossing, the rascal suddenly grabbed up the Daoist’s clothing, threatening to run off with it.\n\nThe Daoist bowed respectfully to him and said, “Please return my clothes to me, and I won’t be stingy about teaching you some magic.” However, the young scoundrel was afraid the Daoist wouldn’t follow through, so he refused to give back the clothes. “Are you sure you want me to teach you?” the Daoist asked.\n\nThe rascal replied, “That’s right.”\n\nThe Daoist then became quiet and didn’t utter a word; instantly, the young man saw the yellow silk ribbon change into a snake that was several hand widths in circumference, and curl itself into six or seven coils, its eyes angry as it held its head up, flicking out its tongue as it faced the rascal. He was terrified, and fell to his knees, turning blue and gasping for breath, unable to say anything but to beg for his life.\n\nThe Daoist finally retrieved the ribbon. The ribbon by then was no longer a snake; but now the young scoundrel had himself become a snake that wriggled into a wall and disappeared. From this point forward, the Daoist’s reputation became even more exceptional.\n\nNobles and officials all heard about his strange activities, and invited the Daoist to visit them; hence he went to see them at an official’s country estate. When some Jinan administrators heard all about the Daoist’s reputation, they invited him to come every time they held banquets together.\n\nOne day, the Daoist invited these administrators to the Tianxin Shuimian Pavilion, to have a drink together. When the appointed day arrived, all of them received invitation letters on their office desks, though no one knew how they’d been delivered.\n\nThey all appeared at the pavilion, and the Daoist came out and reverentially greeted everyone. But when they went inside, they found the pavilion empty and silent, no seats or tables set up, and everyone began to think that perhaps their host had played a joke on them.\n\nThe Daoist looked at the administrators and said, “I have no servants of my own, so I’ll trouble you, if I may, to borrow a number of yours to help out for a little while.” The administrators consented for him to do so. The Daoist then painted a pair of doors on the wall, and knocked on them with his hand.\n\nInside, someone answered, and with the rattling of a key, the doors were opened up. Together the guests hurried to look through, and saw flickering movements of people within; there were screens and curtains, couches and tables, and everything else needed to accommodate them. Then someone began to convey things through the doorway.\n\nThe Daoist directed the administrators’ servants to take and seat them in the pavilion, and to urge each of them not to say anything to any of the people already inside. They could accept the others’ greetings, but only watch and smile. In a moment, the pavilion was filled with furnishings that were incredibly lavish and beautiful.\n\nAfterwards, the scent of an excellent wine mixed with that of smoked, roasted meat, and both were delivered from the inside room to the guests outside the doors. The seated guests, without exception, were astonished.\n\nThe pavilion was located beside the waters of a lake, and every six months, several dozen _qing_ of lotus flowers would appear, so one couldn’t see them all with a single glance. The banquet was taking place then in icy winter, and outside a huge window, nothing could be seen but a dark fog.\n\nOne official happened to comment, “This has been a lovely gathering today, but it’s a pity that there were no lotus flowers to adorn it!” The crowd all agreed with him.\n\nIn a short while, an official’s servant, dressed in dark green, hurried in and announced, “The lotus leaves have filled the lake!” The seated guests were all amazed. When they opened the window and stared out over the lake, they saw green stems everywhere they looked, among which were scattered lotus buds.\n\nThen in a flash, ten thousand plants, and a thousand flowers, burst into blossom; the north wind blew in the guests’ faces, bringing them the fragrance of lotuses. Everyone thought this quite miraculous. Then they sent a servant of one of the administrators out in a boat to pick some of the lotuses. From their vantage point, they could see the servant enter the vast expanse of flowers; when he returned shortly in his boat, they could see that he was empty-handed.\n\nWhen the administrators asked him about it, the servant replied, “I rode out in the boat and saw the flowers stretching into the distance; gradually I arrived at the north shore of the lake, then I turned around, and saw them waving in the lake all the way to the south shore.”\n\nThe Daoist laughed, and said, “This was an illusion, and there were no flowers.”\n\nShortly thereafter, when their drinking came to an end, the lotuses began to wither and drop their petals; the north wind suddenly came up, tore apart the lotus leaves, and then they were gone.\n\nAn official in Jidong district was fond of the Daoist, so he invited him to his headquarters. Yet every day, he treated the Daoist with disrespect. One day, the official invited some guests to drink there with him. The official had all of his best, aged wine stored away, and would pour out only one cup of it at a gathering.\n\nThat same day, as the guests were drinking and enjoying themselves, they kept asking for the good wine. The official firmly stated that it was already gone. The Daoist laughed, and said to the guests, “If you want to satisfy your greedy thirsts, you just need to ask for it from me.” The guests asked him to provide them with the wine.\n\nThe Daoist took a jug, slipped it inside his sleeve, then immediately brought it back out, and began pouring it everywhere where people were seated, the replacement wine tasting no different than the official’s private supply of stored wine. Everyone enjoyed themselves fully from beginning to end.\n\nThe official became suspicious, and went inside to look into his private wine vessels, which seemed to be tightly sealed, but proved to be absolutely empty. He felt he’d been shamefully robbed, so he grabbed the Daoist like he thought he was a demon, and started flogging him. As the blows fell on the Daoist’s body, the official’s own thighs began to hurt quite painfully; in addition, the flesh of his buttocks felt like it was going to split.\n\nThough the Daoist seemed to cry out painfully, it was the official’s own seat that became wet with dark red blood. He stopped beating the Daoist, and chased him out, ordering him to go away.\n\nThe Daoist then left Jinan, but no one knew where he’d gone. Later on, one fellow ran into him in Nanjing, his attire exactly the same as before; and when the man asked him how he was, he just smiled, and didn’t say a word.",
